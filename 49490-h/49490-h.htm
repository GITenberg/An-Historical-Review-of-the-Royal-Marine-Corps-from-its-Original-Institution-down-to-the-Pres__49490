<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>All changes noted in the ERRATA (<a href="#Page_xvi">pg xvi</a>) have been applied to the
etext.</p>

<p>Sometimes the currency symbol l (for libra, pounds) was used instead
of Â£. This has been changed to <i>l</i> for clarity. For example, 50l is
represented as 50<i>l</i>.</p>

<p>The first eighteen chapters of the original text had much more whitespace between
paragraphs than the later chapters. This is reflected in the etext.</p>

<p class="customcover">The cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p class="pad2"><i>Most Gracious Prince</i>,</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">W</span>ith mixed sentiments of Loyalty and Gratitude, I now lay the
following Work under your Royal Shelter.</p>

<p>In having deigned to become its Patron your Royal Highness has
placed me under a double tie, as it is a precious mark of
condescension bestowed upon myself, enhanced in value from its
being a sure earnest of predilection for my Corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>To cherish Patriotism, Subordination and Allegiance, is the
bounden duty of every subject; but more peculiarly so, during times
of public danger, and of general convulsion. This has been my
leading aim, not by the displays of Theory, but of Facts.</p>

<p>Conscious that such were my predominant motives, and anxious
to maintain consistency throughout, I looked around for a Protector
who united within himself all those exalted endowments which
I have laboured to establish. My eyes turned towards your Royal
Highness, and my pen did not solicit in vain.</p>

<p>With talents filled for an honorable discharge of the most
important trusts; early trained in the hardy employs of a profession
which has long been the prop of the British Empire; and a Prince
of the greatest Realm on earth, your Royal Highness has nobly
foregone all those pre-eminent claims, and with a manly humility,
you have associated yourself, in arms, with the Volunteers of your
Country.</p>

<p>Although the field of glory may not be so wide as on that
element for which your Royal Highness was destined from your
youth, and where you are so well qualified to shine, still you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
exhibited the brightest example to Englishmen, and by it alone,
you have already rendered the most signal services.</p>

<p>The deed, august Prince, will be reviewed by Posterity with
all the generous feelings of Britons; and it must convince the
collected hosts of a rapacious enemy, now arrayed for the avowed
purpose of overturning our Religion, our Liberties, and our Laws, of
the many serious dangers which they must encounter, ere they can
subdue those Isles, where but one spirit pervades, and animates
every rank, from the Palace to the Cottage.</p>

<p>Were I allowed to penetrate into futurity, and were your
energies to be ever called forth, I should then behold your Royal
Highness emulating the recognized valour of your illustrious
Ancestors, by deeds of heroic gallantry against the foes of your
revered Father, and of his Throne; but I will forbear to dwell upon
the issues of an after day.</p>

<p>Whether it shall be your lot to wave your banner or your flag
in combat against the enemies of our land, may victory and success
ever follow in your train, and may your Royal Highness enjoy the
honorary recompence of a Brave Nation, annexed to its habitual
respect for your public virtue, and your private worth!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, Most Gracious Prince, are the cordial wishes of one, who
has the distinguished privilege of attesting that fidelity and devotion,
with which he remains,</p>

<p class="pad6">Your Royal Highness's,</p>
<p class="pad10">Very attached,</p>
<p class="right padr2">And most obedient humble Servant,</p>

<div class="fs90">

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>here is no Fame so liable to decay as that which has been acquired by
the subordinate Soldier. The admiration and applause too, which follow
military deeds, however brilliant, are but fickle passions, as they successively
transfer their affections to every new conqueror, and all are too often
buried in the same grave, after the trumpet of war has ceased to sound.</p>

<p>To drag from the land of forgetfulness, actions, long lain in oblivion;
to place the revolutions and the achievements of a corps, endeared to its
Country by a train of loyalty and valour, in one connected and analysed
point of view, were the leading motives which urged the Author to essay a
history of its origin and progress. Whilst he laments that the undertaking
has not been allotted to superior talents, at the same time he will venture
to affirm that it could not have been prosecuted with a stronger zeal.</p>

<p>Never was military prowess more loudly called for, than at the present
crisis.&mdash;Ardour should be raised in every rank. It is a plant, which, by
fostering attention flourishes and grows; but if neglected, soon droops and
dies. Courage is the natural birth-right of an Englishman, and it needs
only a directing hand, under Providence, to give it an invincible aim.</p>

<p>It is policy then, as well as justice, to stamp upon record the feats of
the meanest, anxiously to search for worthy examples in every walk, and
to proclaim them to their brethren, and to the world, as merited tributes,
and powerful incentives to achievement.</p>

<p>The Author regrets that his range has been so limited, and that, in
many instances, the adduced anecdotes have not been more specific; but
the foundation stone is laid, upon which a structure may yet be reared. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
trusts, therefore, that the following request may not be unavailing, which is,&mdash;That
his brother Officers will have the goodness to preserve, in written
memorial, the names of those gallant fellows who may hereafter distinguish
themselves, as well as a minute description of the circumstances.</p>

<p>As error is a bye path to knowledge, he anticipates from the members of
his own household, corrections of the many defects which have unavoidably
crept into a work of such miscellaneous detail.</p>

<p>A Soldier from his infancy, he begs that the public, and <i>those who
controul its opinions</i>, may be tender with the lash! It would be a pity to
bring a veteran, for his first offence, to the halberts, and that too for
grammatical inaccuracies.&mdash;He has taken up the pen merely to be useful,
not in the pursuit of literary fame.</p>

<p>The arrangement of his subject will appear classed under distinct
chapters, which engross the events of each separate year, excepting such as
comprehend the intervals of peace; a season that yields little interesting
matter, and what is uniformly comprized in one division.</p>

<p>An Appendix is added, which contains the essence of every Act of
Parliament now in force, so far as they affect the interests of the families, the
widows, or representatives of the forlorn orphans of Seamen and Marines. A
reference to it, will enable the Clergyman or private Gentleman, to become
the immediate and solid friend of these meritorious and destitute objects, as
the regular mode of transaction and correspondence is clearly pointed out,
by which, to realize their little properties.</p>

<p>The Author takes this public method of tendering his warmest thanks
to the many respectable characters in this loyal spot, who have befriended
his labours, and to that wide circle of Royalty, Nobility, and Gentry, who,
although strangers to him, have yet deigned to countenance the humble
individual, from affection to his Corps.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">A</span>t a period when the commerce of this Country bore no proportion
to its present state, the supplies of Seamen, under a system of impress,
were extremely precarious, and often inadequate to the public
emergencies. Experience had also shewn, that raw landsmen were
most improper substitutes for this want, as the sudden change of life
rendered them subject to immediate disease, and sea-sickness, at a
time when their active services were required.</p>

<p>These united causes originally suggested the expediency of forming
an establishment of Marines, who were raised and embodied with
the sole view of being a nursery to man our fleets. They were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
quartered in the vicinity of our principal sea-ports, where they were
regularly trained to the different methods of ship fighting, and to
these various manÅuvres of a vessel, in which numbers were necessary.
Being thus locally placed, their value was early felt by
their exertions in equipping the squadrons fitted out, when but little
confidence could be placed in the sailor, perhaps just impressed into
the service.</p>

<p>The general principles and regulations that were instituted for the
conduct of the Marine regiments, from their formation, to the close of
the reign of King William III. evidently shew that they were entirely
devoted to naval purposes. As each individual became properly
qualified to act on board of ship as a foremast-man, which was uniformly
encouraged, he was discharged from his regiment, entered
upon the books as such, and levy-money was granted to the officers
of his corps, in order to supply the vacancy of him who was thus
transferred.</p>

<p>The first authentic instance of any regiment of this description
appears in the Army List of 1684, and from the return of the
general review on Putney Heath, upon the first day of October
in that year. Neither the exact Ã¦ra of its establishment, or that of
the other maritime forces, is clearly ascertained; and it would be
absurd to speculate upon dates which can yield no material result.</p>

<p>The return which I have mentioned runs thus, and is annexed at
large: "The Lord High Admiral of England, his Royal Highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

<p>This regiment consisted of twelve companies, without any grenadiers,
had yellow coats lined with red, and their colours were a red
cross, with rays of the sun issuing from each of its angles. It stood
the third in seniority in the line of that day; and it may be presumed,
from its subsequent reduction, that a step was obtained in it by the
4th, <i>then</i> the Regiment of Holland, commanded by John, the second
Lord Mulgrave, and now entitled The Old Buffs.</p>

<p>Betwixt 1687 and 1698, there were several maritime regiments
raised for the purposes, and under the regulations I have stated.
They were Colonels Mordaunt, Colt, Seymour, and Brudenell's;
also, Sir Cloudesley Shovel's, my Lord Torrington's, and the Marquis
of Carmarthen's; all of which were disbanded during the currency
of 1697 and 1698.</p>

<p>The expences incurred by the maintenance of the maritime troops
were classed with the estimates of the navy, and money was issued
from time to time, by warrant from the Lord High Treasurer to the
Treasurer of the Navy, who placed it in the hands of a person
especially appointed to receive and pay it. Under this system, the
Admiralty and Navy Boards were subjected to much trouble, in
forming and directing its different arrangements.</p>

<p>From the nature of the marine service, at this period, few or no
achievements occur which can be peculiarly attached to it as a corps.
We find them honourably mentioned in the operations against St.
Christopher's, and the successful attack upon Cork, under the Ã¦ra of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
1690. The detail of loss upon the former occasion is thus described,
and evinces that their energies also, as soldiers, were called forth
when occasion might require them. "In this action we had killed
and wounded upwards of 130 men, and Captain Keigwin, <i>a
sea commander</i>, who was appointed <i>Colonel of the Marine Regiment</i>,
(which consisted of about 230 <i>seamen</i>) was shot through the thigh,
of which wound he died, before he could be carried on board, and
Captain Brisbane, who <i>acted as First Captain to the Marines</i>, receiving
a shot through the body, expired that night on board the
Bristol."</p>

<p>Embodied under similar circumstances, they of course partook
in the various services of debarkation, which the emergency of those
times might have demanded, until the peace of Ryswick, which,
for a while, closed the existence of marine forces.</p>

<p>The expences of King William's war, upwards of eight years'
duration, are so moderate when contrasted with these of later days,
that they merit a place in any retrospect which treats of that period;
and it is to be remarked that 40,000 seamen were maintained during
the last years of it.</p>

<p>In all, thirty-four millions seven hundred sixty-four thousand
three hundred eighty-five pounds, twelve shillings and ten

<p>I cannot bid adieu to the transactions of this auspicious reign,
which has established the happiness and the liberties of my country,
without commenting upon two events of it, that must be materially
interesting to every military man&mdash;I mean the code of laws for the
good order and discipline of our armies, and the grant of half-pay
bestowed upon disbanded officers.</p>

to restrain the uncontrouled outrages of a discontented soldiery, on
account of arrears due to them. This act was passed in great haste
upon the 12th day of April, 1689, and has progressively experienced
these various improvements that arise out of occasions. It undergoes
annually a legislative sanction, under the title of the Mutiny Bill.</p>

<p>Half-pay was a gift decreed upon the 18th of January, 1697,
and has subsequently involved many a doubt, whether as having
been intended in the light of a retaining fee, or as a reward for
past services. Opposite decisions have authorised different constructions,
while the lapse of more than one hundred years has not yet
explicitly brought the point to an issue.</p>

<p>The manly and independent spirit of our judges, pure as these laws
that controul their opinions, has not been able to adjust the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of General Ross, which was submitted to their
enquiry and determination&mdash;they resolved that he could not be
amenable, <i>as a half-pay officer</i>, to military jurisdiction; but the
discussion extended no farther.</p>

<p>In 1715 a number of officers, however, who drew this recompence
from the public, most ingloriously joined the Pretender. The issue
being unfortunate for them, they were all taken prisoners, and
afterwards tried and executed by <i>martial</i> law; although they might
have been capitally convicted <i>as rebels, by the common law of the
land</i>.</p>

<p>In having adduced these opposite examples, I cannot withhold
a remark, that under no one head of the articles of war is this
description of men noticed; and I can readily anticipate the answer
of an Englishman, were I to ask him if any laws should affect such
an object as I have defined, in which he is not expressly
specified?</p>

<p>In this flourishing country, where industry and enterprize are open
to all, it often happens that an officer, when the State no longer
wants his services, turns his attention and the little capital he may
possess, to commercial pursuits. In this new profession he very
probably advances the public interests more essentially than were
he recalled to his former duties, upon every fresh emergency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>That</i> patriotism and loyalty, which I am convinced in those
days influence every soldier, who, in the smallest portion, tastes
of the bread of his King, will enforce through each quarter of
Britain a local activity, and when necessary, a military zeal.
As volunteer companies in the present, and very probably under
the future political circumstances of our country, must form a
branch of our force, who are there more capable of animating
them than men who have been trained to arms, whose allegiance
is undisputed, and whose early sentiments and ideas no
change of life can extinguish? Some legislative assurances of
exemption in favour of officers of this description, and who engage
to discharge the obligations of general association when required,
would be politic and gratifying. Half-pay might also very properly
be no longer considered as a retainder of those who have served any
marked number of years; for I would discriminate between the
veteran and the stripling, who are alike entitled to the same
remuneration; though, I should humbly conceive, to separate indulgencies.
Having made this digression, suited, I trust, to the present
topic and the present times, I return to the train of my narrative.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">U</span>pon the death of King William III. whose royal memory must
long be dear to Englishmen, Queen Anne ascended the British
throne. Previous to this event, the seeds of a new war had been
forming, which was proclaimed against France and Spain, upon the
4th day of May, 1702.</p>

<p>The French King having advanced his grandson, the Duke of
Anjou to the vacant Spanish monarchy, her Majesty espoused the
interests and claims of the Archduke of Austria upon that sovereignty,
and resolved upon sending a strong fleet into the Mediterranean,
which was to become the theatre of their hostile efforts.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of her reign was a revival of the corps of
Marines, but they were placed upon a different footing from these
that existed under her royal predecessor. Destined for the mingled
and active services of co-operation with the well-trained forces of
our allies, along with a new establishment, a new constitution was
also requisite. Their meritorious conduct, as soldiers, in the subsequent
duties that were allotted them, reflected honour upon their
discipline and their country, and they shared in the royal thanks of
Him whose cause they maintained, by their frequent debarkations
upon the sea-coasts of France, Spain, and Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Her Majesty's order for levying this body of men was issued upon
the first day of June, 1702, and runs thus:</p>

<p class="pad4">ANNE R.</p>

<p class="negidt2 pad4">"Our pleasure is, that this establishment of six regiments
of Marines, and six other regiments, for <i>sea service</i>,
do commence and take place from the respective times
of raising. And our farther pleasure is, That the order
given by our dearest Brother the late King deceased,
and such orders as are or shall be given by us
touching the pay or entertainment of our said forces,
or any of them, or any charges thereunto belonging,
shall be duly complied with, and that no new charge
be added to this establishment, without being communicated
to our High Treasurer, or Commissioners
of our Treasury for the time being.</p>

<p class="negidt2 pad4">"Given at our Court at St. James's, first day of June in the
first year of our reign.</p>

<p class="right padr4">
"By her Majesty's command,</p>

<p class="right smcap">"Godolphin."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>I annex, also, the expences incurred by one regiment of this
description, which will be a guide to the total charge for the whole
of them.</p>

<p>The six regiments of Foot for <i>sea service</i> were exactly the same
numbers and same denominations, excepting as to officers, who
among these corps, were detailed as Ensigns instead of Second Lieutenants.
Classed under one general head, the twelve regiments cost
the public Â£238 14 0 <i>per day</i>, and Â£174,251 0 0 <i>per year</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of this class of men being raised with a view of
becoming a nursery for the Navy, seems to have been now relinquished,
and the following articles for their government and
conduct were framed, and adopted, by her Majesty in council, upon
the 1st of July, 1702.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>1st. They were to be employed on board her Majesty's ships as
there should be occasion, and quartered at, or as near as might be to
the dock-yards, when on shore, to guard them from embezzlements,
or any attempts of an enemy.</p>

<p>2d. In all matters relating to their subsistence and clearings,
when on board and on shore, they were to be paid in like manner
as the land forces, and the same deductions to be made from them for
clothing, and one day's pay, once a year, from each officer and
soldier for the hospital.</p>

<p>3d. They were to be allowed an equal proportion of provisions
with the seamen, without any deductions from their pay for the
same.</p>

<p>4th. And to have the same allowance for short provisions (when
circumstances render the issue of full allowance imprudent) as the
seamen, to be paid to themselves, or their assigns.</p>

<p>5th. Such regiments, or parts of them as should be on shore,
were to be mustered by a commissary or commissaries in the same
manner as the land forces, excepting in this case, that they, the said
commissaries, were obliged to allow at each muster on his or their
rolls, all such officers and soldiers as should appear to him or them
by authentic vouchers, or certificates, to be put on board any of her
Majesty's ships or vessels, and that such part of the aforesaid regiments
as should be at sea, might be paid while they were so, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
directed, That the commanding Marine Officer with them should,
every two months, return to the Commissary General of the Musters
a perfect list of all the officers and soldiers on board each ship, signed
by himself, and all the Marine Officers, expressing the times of
entry, death, and discharge of each man, that so the Commissary
might compare the said lists with the monthly books sent to the Navy
Office, and allow such of the officers and soldiers as should appear
to him fit to be so allowed.</p>

<p>6th. To prevent confusion, not less than fifteen Marine Soldiers,
and with them an Officer, were to be put on board a ship, at any
one time, unless in cases of necessity.</p>

<p>7th. And for the ease of the whole a particular Pay-master was
appointed, with power to solicit the arrears of the regiments, and to
receive all sums of money from the Treasurer of the Navy; and
immediately upon the receipt thereof, to issue the same to the
respective Colonels, or their Agents; he was also required, diligently
and carefully to adjust all accounts relating to the regiments, according
to such muster rolls as should be delivered to him by the
Commissary, or Commissaries; and those muster rolls were to be
allowed of, as sufficient vouchers for the charges in the accounts, and
for making out debentures and warrants.</p>

<p>8th. To enable the aforesaid Pay-master to keep an Office, and
to defray the charge thereof, and of Clerks and other contingencies,
he was allowed sixpence in the pound, pursuant to the subscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the respective Colonels, which he had power to deduct out of all
monies issued to him, in the same manner as the poundage was deducted
from the land forces.</p>

<p>9th. For rendering such parts of the regiments as should be on
shore the more useful, her Majesty declared it should be left to herself,
or the High Admiral, to dispose of them at such places nearest to the
several dock yards, as might be judged most convenient: And since
there might be occasion for Labourers to dispatch necessary works,
her Majesty empowered her High Admiral, or the Commissioners
for executing that office, to cause to be employed in the aforesaid dock
yards, so many of the Marine Soldiers as might be judged fitting, and
to make them such daily allowance for the same, besides their ordinary
pay, as to him or them should seem reasonable.</p>

<p>Thus placed under the controul of the Lord High Admiral, he
was pleased to nominate Brigadier General Seymour to superintend
the whole; whose peculiar duties were to observe, that the men were
comfortably quartered, that the officers were attentive in their respective
departments, and that the Marine Soldiers, when embarked on
board of ship, were supplied with proper sea clothes, and other suitable
necessaries.</p>

<p>During this reign also, a number of independent companies of
Marines was raised for the express purpose of defending our different
West India possessions, to which quarter they were sent, were embodied
into three regiments, and where they remained many years.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. III.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">I</span>n order to pave the way for the cordial reception of King Charles
the III. orders were sent to Sir Cloudesley Shovel, then commanding
the British Fleet in the Mediterranean, to effect what he could by
conciliation, or by conquest, amongst the different dependencies of
the French and Spanish monarchies, previous to the arrival of the
Royal Claimant. Throughout the whole of that Admiral's instructions,
much dependence was placed upon the energies of the Marine
Forces under his command, and they subsequently bore a conspicuous
share of the mingled services that ensued, in the cause of the House
of Austria. This circumstance may evince the very high estimation
in which they were held as Soldiers, although nothing materially
occurred either under the command of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, or during
the currency of 1703.</p>

<p>After many delays the Archduke arrived at Lisbon, with Sir
George Rooke, upon the 25th day of February 1704, in order to concert
a plan of future operations with his ally, the King of Portugal. The
Admiral was enjoined to attempt nothing without the suggestion and
assent of Both.</p>

<p>The first enterprize was against Barcelona, whither they were
invited by some deputies from Catalonia, and a few leading men in
the city, who gave assurances that it would declare for Charles the III.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
if a shew of attack only was made. Here 1600 Marines were landed,
at the request and under the command of the Prince of Hesse, upon the
noon of the 19th of May. This force being inadequate for the purpose,
it was next day re-embarked at the instance of his Highness. Listening
to the wishes of their Majesties, in conformity with his instructions,
the Admiral would have attempted Cadiz; but, upon deliberation,
and that there was no army to co-operate, this idea was given up.</p>

<p>They accordingly turned their thoughts to Gibraltar, where the
Prince of Hesse was landed in the afternoon of the 21st of July, with
1800 British and Dutch Marines. Proceeding upon the decision of
a Council of War, his Highness was to cut off all communication
with the main land, to bombard and cannonade the place, and to
reduce it to the obedience of the King of Spain.</p>

<p>Having established his post at some mills then near the town, he
sent a summons for the Governor to surrender; who answered, that
all his garrison had taken an oath of allegiance to their lawful
Sovereign, King Philip the V. and that as loyal and faithful subjects,
they would die in its defence.</p>

<p>The Admiral having directed a strong force to proceed against the
south mole, the enemy were driven from their guns.&mdash;A number of
boats manned and armed, were then detached under the gallant conduct
of Capt. Whitaker, of the Navy, who soon obtained possession
of the great platform; but about one hundred, whose impetuous
bravery had carried them within the effects of a mine connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with the fort, were killed and wounded by its explosion. The rest,
however, advancing most rapidly, gained a redoubt, half-way
between the mole and the town.</p>

<p>This attack being made upon a Sunday, almost the whole of the
women belonging to the garrison, were performing their devotions in
a chapel about four miles distant; so that the besieging forces were
between them and their husbands and families.</p>

<p>This circumstance hastened the fall of the place, for the citizens
within strongly urged the Governor to capitulate; who being thus
almost compelled to it, the Prince of Hesse, at the head of the
Marines, marched in upon the evening of the 24th.&mdash;The garrison,
indeed, was only composed of two skeleton regiments; but the
strength of the fortifications, the number of cannon mounted being
upwards of 100 pieces towards the sea, and the two narrow passes of
approach from the land, would have rendered it formidable to an
enemy who possessed not the dash of enterprize. Our loss, in the
attempt, was 61 killed, and 206 wounded.</p>

<p>In October of the same year, the Garrison, composed of Marines
under the Prince of Hesse, sustained a siege by 7000 men. The purpose
of the enemy was to have stormed from the south mole, united
with the desperate attempt of a Spanish forlorn hope climbing the
rock, and a general attack from the main land. Against very superior
forces Gibraltar was maintained, until relieved by Sir John Leake,
who reinforced the place with 2000 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>This Fortress, seated upon the territories of our natural foe, has
long stood a monument of our naval power, which has oftener than
once been especially devoted to relieve its wants; and has also
afforded to the world, a brilliant instance of military defence under
the late Lord Heathfield.</p>

<p>Nothing worthy of notice occurred until the month of September
1705, when it was deemed essential by the Earl of Peterborough
Commander in Chief, to attempt something worthy of our arms, and
the service of the King.</p>

<p>At the desire of his Lordship, a large body of Seamen and Marines
were landed at Barcelona, who were auxiliary in the reduction of
that important place, at which his Majesty was present.</p>

<p>This city was destined to an attack from the enemy, early in 1706,
whither Sir John Leake, having the Earl of Peterborough on board,
proceeded in April.</p>

<p>His Majesty, King Charles, who was then within its walls, very
strongly urged the immediate debarkation of all our forces; upon
which, 1400 land troops, and the Marines of the fleet, were on the
9th of April, sent to his aid. Their appearance was well timed, as
the French had made a practicable breach, which they would otherwise
have stormed upon the following day.&mdash;After repeated attempts
they relaxed in their efforts, and many volunteers from the city, as
well as peasants from the mountains pouring down in numbers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
obliged them to raise the siege precipitately, upon the 11th.&mdash;After
ten at night the enemy began to retreat; but first setting fire to their
magazines, and placing matches to their mines. Many of the former,
however, were preserved by the natives, and a number of the latter
were extinguished by the soldiery. The morning's dawn presented
their army retreating in disorder, and grievously harassed by our
troops, and the enraged Catalans.</p>

<p>An eclipse of the sun, followed by a total darkness about nine,
suspended for a while every operation, which, when dissipated, the
slaughter was renewed, till prudence recalled them from the carnage.
The enemy's camp, with 100 brass cannon, and stores of every
description, were the fruits of our efforts.</p>

<p>Having thus relieved this important place, the fleet sailed upon
the 18th of May, and landed the forces of every description, upon
the coast of Valencia on the 25th.</p>

<p>This was preparatory to the attack of Alicant, which was deemed
almost impregnable.&mdash;Having been apprized that it was reinforced,
and that a regular siege alone could reduce it, the idea was dropped
for a time, and they proceeded against Carthagena, which immediately
submitted; and where a garrison of 600 Marines under Major Hedges,
<i>who was appointed Governor of it</i>, was established for its defence.</p>

<p>An attempt upon Alicant was then resolved upon; but Brigadier
Gorge having upon a close review of the place, and learning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
resolute spirit of its Governor, Major General Mahoni, represented
that not less than 3000 men were necessary to reduce it.&mdash;Having
with him not more than 1450 troops, and he being of opinion that no
dependence could be placed in the Spanish Militia, it was determined
to withdraw the garrison of Marines from Carthagena, in order
to assist in these active operations, and to put another in its stead.</p>

<p>The fleet arrived off Alicant, upon the 26th of June, when a
summons was forwarded to General Mahoni, who, like an Officer,
answered, that he would hold out to the last. His force consisted of
more than 1000 Soldiers, and many inhabitants of the town, who had
volunteered in its defence.</p>

<p>Brigadier Gorge having moved from Elche upon the 21st of July,
where he had remained waiting for reinforcements, to within a mile
of Alicant, all the Marines of the fleet, with 800 Seamen, were
landed upon that day, and the following morning, and the bombardment
commenced in the evening of the 22d. A detachment of the
Naval force under Sir George Byng, rendered very essential service,
by dismounting many of the enemy's guns opposed to the sea, and
driving the men from them.</p>

<p>Upon the 24th of July, the Marines arrived from Carthagena, and
were immediately landed. Four days after, when the troops had gained
possession of the suburbs, all the boats were manned and armed, in
order to attack the town. On the 29th, the ships having made a
practicable breach in the round tower, at the west end of the place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and another at the middle of the curtain, between the mole and the
easternmost bastion, the Soldiers advanced to storm them. An Officer
with fifteen Grenadiers rashly pushed on against the breach in the
town, but were repulsed before they could be supported. Upon this
occasion there were particularly distinguished, Captains Evans,
Passenger, and Watkins, of the Royal Navy. Capt. Evans, at the
head of a few of the boats crews, was the first to mount into the
breach, and they were rapidly seconded by the whole forces, who, upon
reaching the town, secured every post, with but little loss; there
being only 30 killed, and 80 wounded, although the Spaniards had
prepared for this event, by forcing temporary loop holes in their houses,
from which they kept up a sharp fire upon our men as they approached.</p>

<p>General Mahoni now retired into the Castle, and was again
summoned by Brigadier Gorge; his answer was such as became him,
and what might have been expected from his character. At this time
the detached squadron had dismounted many of his guns, beat down
a part of the walls, and his Garrison was extremely annoyed by shells
from the bomb vessels. Composed chiefly of Neapolitans, they at last
compelled the brave Mahoni to yield, who, from this cause alone,
surrendered his charge, after a heavy loss, upon the 25th of August.</p>

<p>Having adjusted every thing, the fleet proceeded to the Island of
Ivica, where it arrived upon the 9th day of September. The Governor
instantly saluted, and tendered submission and obedience to King
Charles the III. It was afterwards resolved to attack Majorca, to the
Viceroy of which a summons was sent in, upon the 14th of September.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
He, with some others in the interest of the Duke of Anjou, appeared
resolute to defend themselves; but when a few shells were thrown
into Palma, the capital, the inhabitants obliged him to retire to his
palace, and there enter into terms. A Garrison of one Captain, one
Lieutenant, and 100 Marines was placed here, and all the disaffected
to our cause, were withdrawn from the island.</p>

<p>Nothing farther, connected with my subject, appears on the face
of the military transactions of this year. In the month of June, 1707,
an opportunity presented of co-operating with the Duke of Savoy and
Prince Eugene in an intended attack upon Toulon. Towards the close
of it, the fleet proceeded for the coast of Italy, where it anchored upon
the 28th, between Nice and Antibes, about a league from the Var.&mdash;A
conference took place on the following day betwixt the Commanders
in Chief, when it was decided, that a joint attack should be made
upon a part of the enemy's army then entrenched upon that river,
before they could be reinforced.</p>

<p>These works being exposed to the fire of the ships, as they could
stand within little more than musket shot, were hastily evacuated, and
in less than an hour they were occupied by 600 Seamen and Marines.
The passage was now open for the Duke of Savoy to prosecute his
destination, while frigates were stationed along the different parts of
the sea coast, in order to keep up a mutual communication.</p>

<p>Having reached Toulon, every aid was afforded by the fleet both
as to men and cannon, but the enemy daily augmenting his forces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and having made a successful sally, induced the raising of this siege
upon the 10th of August, after a loss of more than a thousand men.</p>

<p>One happy result arose from this attempt however, which was,
that the French, under a sudden dread of consequences, sunk a number
of their largest men of war, which were ever after unfit for service.</p>

<p>King Charles having often urged the reduction of Sardinia, with a
view to open a passage for his troops in Naples to attack Sicily, as well
as on account of its sources of supply of all kinds of provisions for his
armies, of which they were much in want, a body of Marines was
drawn from Tarragona, a strong sea port and Garrison in Catalonia,
to assist in this enterprize. Upon the 1st day of August, 1708, the
whole arrived before Cagliari, the capital. Upon receiving a very
equivocal answer to a summons sent in, the bombardment commenced
that evening, and continued without intermission until next
morning, when at the break of day, Major General Wills, and the
whole of the Marines, with one Spanish regiment were landed. The
place, in consequence, almost instantly surrendered.</p>

<p>The whole having been re-embarked, the fleet again set sail,
upon the 18th of August, for Minorca, and arrived at Port Mahon
upon the 25th.</p>

<p>At this period, two of the Marine Regiments were drafted, and
both officers and men were incorporated with the other four, now
employed upon this service. The measure was necessary, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to supply the casualties that had occurred, and to render these corps
effective.&mdash;For this purpose, all the Marines capable of duty, were
drawn from a number of the fleet about to return home, as well as
to assist in the reduction of an island, which, every officer conceived,
would make a spirited and tedious defence.</p>

<p>The first attack was against Fort Fornelle, which was cannonaded
by two of the ships, and fell after a contest of four hours.</p>

<p>A detachment having been pushed to Cittadello, the capital, it
surrendered without resistance.</p>

<p>The batteries were opened on the works defending the town of
Port Mahon, upon the 17th of September, when, after a short but brisk
fire, and the loss of only six men, a lodgment was effected under the
very walls of St. Philip's Castle; and next day the enemy capitulated.</p>

<p>Thus was this strong fortress, and important island, gained by a
force of only 2400 men, while the garrison consisted of more than one
thousand Soldiers, with upwards of 100 pieces of cannon mounted,
and having every thing requisite for sustaining a long siege.</p>

<p>Sir George Byng arrived at Lisbon upon the 14th of October, having
her Majesty the Queen of Portugal on board, but, although many other
objects of service were in contemplation, nothing farther was attempted
during 1708.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>arly in 1709, a plan was formed to attack Port Royal in the
province of Nova Scotia, at that time in possession of the French.&mdash;For
this purpose a body of 400 Marines was embarked, and the
expedition was entrusted to the joint conduct of Colonel Nicholson of
the land forces, and Captain Martin of the navy.&mdash;The squadron
proceeded for Boston, where they were to be reinforced by some ships,
and such provincial auxiliaries, as might be ready, or were necessary
for this intended conquest.</p>

<p>Here a Council of War was held, which arranged the future
operations of a body, now consisting of 2000 men.&mdash;They reached
their destination upon the 24th of September, and the proper ground
for landing having been reconnoitred, the debarkation took place on
the following day.&mdash;The enemy opened a heavy fire upon the boats
from their guns and mortars, but with little effect. A bomb-vessel
drifting up with the tide of flood within reach of the Fort, rendered
important service during the two first days, which was spiritedly
aided by the military exertions on shore.</p>

<p>Upon the first day of October, the Governor of the Fortress having
expressed an inclination to surrender upon terms, they were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
into consideration and agreed to. Here a Garrison of Marines was
left. Having thus reduced the place, it was now named Annapolis
Royal, in honor of her Majesty, under whose auspices it was
conquered.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_V" id="CHAP_V"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. V.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he British Nation, ever true to its Allies, often has had cause
to complain of a want of this reciprocal honour. Limited in my
scope, it belongs not to me to develope errors, and far less to expose
such as have arisen from high causes. But, in vindication of the
military fame of my country and my corps, I have to regret, that the
zealous and gallant services of both should have been unavailingly
exerted in the unprosperous views of King Charles upon the Spanish
monarchy.</p>

<p>To the want of co-operation and unanimity must be ascribed the
many chequered events, and reverses, that marked his royal efforts
during this contest. Unsupported by his family, or his nation, whose
immediate interests it must have been to place him effectively on
that throne, he was exposed to many fatal disappointments when he
could not remedy them, and was thus often obliged to adopt the
measures of necessitous expediency, when he should have been
enabled to prosecute the objects of an arranged system.</p>

<p>Early in 1709, the town of Alicant became hard pressed,
having sustained a long and obstinate siege against a very powerful
force of the combined enemy. The garrison, composed in a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
proportion of Marines, exhibited the most heroic perseverance in
maintaining the place. Unable to reduce it, the besiegers attempted
to undermine the rock upon which the Castle stood, of which they
apprized its defenders; but this had no effect upon their resolution.
A partial shock, which buried above twenty in its effects, did not
intimidate them, and they bravely continued to defend themselves
till the fleet, under Sir George Byng, appeared (I believe) on the 4th
of April.</p>

<p>General Stanhope, with the troops on board, were to have
attempted its relief, under cover of a squadron that was at the
same time to have attacked the enemy's lines along the sea shore;
but a heavy gale coming on, and many of the ships being in shallow
water, it was judged proper to stand farther out into the road.</p>

<p>The weather continuing severe, and being unable to gain any
intelligence as to the state of the garrison, the Commanders in Chief
dreading the worst, and in pity to their sufferings, by a flag of
truce, proposed terms of surrender, which being agreed to, the brave
remnants were embarked on board of the fleet, which now proceeded
to Tarragona, Port Mahon, and afterwards to Barcelona.</p>

<p>During the remainder of this year, nothing farther was attempted
by our squadrons, which, in their attached duties, were employed to
harass the commerce of our foes, and to protect the convoys of
provisions destined wherever necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the 13th of March, 1710, Sir John Norris arrived at Port
Mahon, as Commander in Chief of the Naval Forces. After
having arranged every thing, transporting troops to the different
quarters, where required, and some inferior attacks upon the enemy,
he reached Barcelona upon the 18th of June, in order to concert future
operations with his Majesty.</p>

<p>An expedition was meditated against Cette, in the province of
Languedoc, where the Troops and Marines were landed upon the
13th of July. The place made but a feeble resistance; and the
fort, upon which eighteen pieces of cannon were mounted, surrendered
the same day. Major General Seissau, then advancing against
Adge with the regiment of Stanhope, and three hundred Marines,
that town was delivered up without resistance.</p>

<p>The Isle of Cette, however, was shortly afterwards recovered by
the French army stationed in the province under the Duke de
Roquelaure; but all our soldiers were previously re-embarked.</p>

<p>Nothing further occurred in 1710, which is in any respect connected
with my subject.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>arly in 1711 it was resolved to attempt the town of Quebec,
the capital of the French dominions in Canada, for which service
Sir Hovenden Walker and General Hill were nominated as Commanders
in Chief. A respectable force was appointed, and they
were directed to proceed for Boston, in New England, there to
arrange every thing necessary for this undertaking. They reached
Nantasket, near Boston, upon the 24th of June, and having prepared
the Provincial Corps, and withdrawn the Marines who garrisoned
Annapolis Royal since its surrender, they sailed for the object of their
destination, after many delays, upon the 30th of July.</p>

<p>This attempt was rashly adopted, without examining the difficulties
it involved. The urgent suggestions of the American Provinces
first gave the idea, in order to get rid of a hostile and dangerous
neighbour, but their energies were by no means adequate to the
extent of their designs. A general ignorance of the navigation
of the river St. Laurence very early exposed us to the loss of more
than 800 brave men, who perished from this fatal cause, and these
sad examples put a period to an expedition formed in misrepresentation,
and conducted by incapacity.</p>

<p>The whole squadron and forces returned to England on the 9th of
October, after having left the provincial auxiliaries upon their own
coast.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">S</span>ir John Jennings arrived at Barcelona upon the 20th of March,
1711, in order to assume the command of the British Fleet.</p>

<p>To watch the enemies ports, to distress their trade, and to keep
open the communication of intelligence and supplies for the detached
forces of our Allies, were all that he could now attempt in the
tottering cause of King Charles the Third.</p>

<p>About this time died Joseph, Emperor of Germany, whose bequeath
of all his dominions to our Royal Competitor compensated for past
struggles, and averted that blow to his pride which must soon have
ensued from the desperate state of his affairs, by a total dereliction of
his object.</p>

<p>That event called upon him to fill the throne of his country; to
obey which, his Majesty soon after embarked on board the English
fleet, and was escorted to Italy.</p>

<p>His Royal Consort still remained behind, with a view to inspire
a motive for farther efforts, but the suspension of arms between Great
Britain and France put a period to every active co-operation. The
Empress, with her retinue, embarked at Barcelona, early in 1712, and
landed at Genoa upon the 26th of March, from whence she prosecuted
her journey towards the destined seat of her power.</p>

<p>After a tedious negociation, the stages, or the detailed terms, of
which it is not my task to retrace, peace was restored by the Treaty
of Utrecht, on the 31st of March, 1713. We retained possession of
Gibraltar, Minorca, and Nova Scotia; each conquered by our arms
during the war, and in effecting all of which the Marine forces,
established during the reign of Queen Anne, very essentially contributed.</p>

<p>The extraordinary expences of this long war, notwithstanding
its duration, did not much exceed forty-four millions, which, considering
the immense forces kept on foot, and the subsidies granted
to so many of the Continental Powers, appear but a small sum.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>The death of the Lord High Admiral, in a retrospective view, also
produced some trivial reforms in the constitution of the Marine Regiments,
which were accomplished under the auspices of the same
ministry that had framed their original regulations. Some existing
abuses were, I believe, the pretext for this change, as the Commissaries,
after the decease of the Royal Consort, were enjoined to transmit their
accounts, and otherwise correspond with the Secretary at War, upon
the subject of these establishments. Many omissions seem to have prevailed
in making regular returns from the different detachments, necessarily
extended over every quarter of the globe, which first arising from
individual neglect, ultimately retarded the proceedings of the Commissioners,
who were appointed to investigate the national expenditure, at
the close of the war. The following is their report upon this head:</p>

<p>"Soon after the commencement of our Commission, we required
Mr. Whitfield, late Pay-master of the Marines, to lay the accompts
of these Regiments before us; which after many delays he did,
but in a very imperfect manner.</p>

<p>"We insisted upon a more distinct accompt, whereupon he,
(being very ill) sent his chief Clerk Mr. Sizer to us, who deposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that the accompts could not be made more perfect without muster
rolls, which Mr. Lynn the Commissary had not returned.</p>

<p>"In answer to this, Mr. Lynn hath declared, that he could not
make up the muster rolls farther than the 24th of December, 1709,
for want of the ships books, and the certificates from the Agents
of the Commissioners of the sick and wounded: which books and
certificates could not be had from the distant parts of the service,
till those employed there came to England.</p>

<p>"These difficulties prevent our stating the accompts of the
Marines, but it is obvious, that the expence of the Navy is
increased by them.</p>

<p>"For the Pay of 8000 Marines, according to the establishment,
amounts to Â£128,133 5 0 <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>"The Pay of 8000 <i>ordinary</i> Seamen, is Â£98,800 0 0 <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>"The extraordinary charge therefore, is Â£29,333 5 0&mdash;and
how far it may be thought necessary to continue Marines in time
of peace, is humbly left to the judgment and determination of
Parliament.&mdash;The next great expence to the public, is that of the
Navy, &amp;c."</p>

<p>After the work of peace was accomplished, a great reduction of
the forces took place, and the half-pay list for the year 1714, exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>

<p>Tranquillity was scarcely restored to the nation, when it had to
lament the loss of its Sovereign, who closed an amiable and a virtuous
life upon the 1st day of August, 1714.</p>

<p>The eyes and hearts of every Briton, who was capable of appreciating,
and solicitous to maintain the blessings he enjoyed, naturally
turned towards a successor, the recognized virtues of whose illustrious
House, were the surest pledge of a continuance of their religious and
civil liberties.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Crown was tendered to, and accepted by King
George the First, whose wise and mild reign, amidst subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
convulsions, fully realized every hope which the nation had
formed.</p>

<p>He had scarcely been seated on his throne, when a rival appeared,
the unfortunate dupe of the hostile and ambitious designs of France,
against his kingdoms.</p>

<p>But the loyalty of his subjects, and the courage of his troops,
defeated an attempt that must have renewed the evils which urged
on a recent and a glorious Revolution.</p>

<p>In the first year of his Majesty's Government, it was judged
proper to grant a signal mark of royal favour, in consideration of the
extensive and gallant services of the Marine Regiments. Accordingly,
all the officers attached to those of Lieutenant General Holl,
Major General Wills, and Brigadier Barr were restored to their
rank and full pay, and were generally incorporated with the different
corps of the line. Four invalid companies were also granted.</p>

<p>A spirit of public Åconomy, as well as of public jealousy against
the very idea of a standing army, that existed during the Ã¦ra of
which I treat, preclude any retrospective details from me within
the periods of 1715 and 1739&mdash;During those days the very name
of a <i>Marine Soldier</i> carried within it hostility to British liberty.
It was a term which the most enlightened could not comprehend,
and afforded a handle of discussion to the leaders of parliamentary
debates, and of popular prejudices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>During the above interval, the nation encountered a short war,
and was also placed in the attitude of preparation for a second&mdash;but
the events of neither fall within my limited scope; as no force,
except the nominal and unattached title of General of Marines
existed, with four independent companies of invalids.</p>

<p>It was not until 1739, upon the repetition of Spanish cruelties
and aggression towards the industrious and defenceless subjects of
Britain, that the system of Marine Regiments was renewed. The
sword was again drawn upon the 19th of October of that year, and
an Order of Council of the 12th of December, determined upon the
immediate levy of six of this description. The Colonels who were
nominated to command them were as follow:</p>

<p>1st. Edward Wolfe, esq. from 3d Foot Guards.</p>

<p>2d. William Robinson, esq. Lieutenant Colonel from Handyside's
Regiment of Foot.</p>

<p>3d. Anthony Lowther, esq. from 2d. Foot Guards.</p>

<p>4th. John Wynyard, esq. from Colonel Tyrrel's Regiment of
Foot.</p>

<p>5th. Charles Douglas, esq. from Colonel Howard's Regiment
of Foot.</p>

<p>6th. Lewis Ducie Morton, esq. from 3d. Foot Guards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to render them immediately effective, and with a view
to discipline them, five men from each company of the Regiments
of Foot Guards, were appointed as Serjeants and Corporals, and
mingled with the whole.&mdash;That they might also be rapidly completed,
a bounty of one pound ten shillings was tendered to the first 1800 men
of our regular army who should volunteer this transition of service.
It was not long, by the use of such energies, before the whole were
raised, and no part of the royal speech was more generally applauded
than that which proposed this levy. The notion of their being an
appendage to the standing army, seems to have been, at this time,
considerably effaced, though the phantom was still kept alive by
those who studiously search into and proclaim every apparent
grievance. Early in the year 1740, three additional regiments were
raised in America, and the Royal Standard was erected at New York,
as the signal-post to which every volunteer Marine was to repair.</p>

<p>It was supposed, that from climate, the natives of that Continent
were better calculated for the service to which they were destined
than the Europeans, and they were clothed in a manner well adapted
for the future scene of their duties. The Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels,
Majors, and Subalterns, were appointed by the Crown,
and the Captains of Companies were nominated by the American
Provinces. Their uniform was camblet coats, brown linen waist-coats,
and canvas trowsers. Colonel Spotiswood, of Virginia was
Colonel Commandant of the whole.</p>

<p>In January, 1740, the six Marine Regiments received an effective
augmentation of 2040 men, and one Lieutenant to each Company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
An addition also of twenty men was granted to each of the four
Companies of Invalids, and another allowed to the retired Marine
establishment.</p>

<p>Previous to the sailing of Admiral Vernon for the West Indies,
he, in an Address to the Duke of Newcastle, and in terms of an
honest zeal for the public service, thus expresses himself upon the
subject of Marine Soldiers:</p>

<p>"I could wish, indeed, we had each of us a company of regular
troops sent on board of us, which would have strengthened us in
numbers, as well as had their expertness in handling their arms,
to have incited our Seamen to the imitation of them. If we should
come to a general war with France as well as Spain, I believe
your Grace will have already perceived, from the difficulty of
manning these ships as they are, the necessity there may be of
converting most of our marching regiments into Marines; and if,
as they become Seamen, they were admitted to be discharged as
such, that would make a good nursery for breeding them, at a
time we might probably find such a necessity for them.</p>

<p>"As I have always looked upon our fleet as what must not
only protect our trade, but secure us the blessings of a Protestant
succession, your Grace will be so good as to excuse the overflowing
of a sincere, though it may be an imprudent zeal; being strongly
convinced in my own judgment, that preserving a superiority at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sea is the best security of his Majesty's government, as well as the
trade and prosperity of this kingdom."</p>

<p>The above ideas seem principally drawn from that system which
existed as to the Marine previous to the reign of Queen Anne, and
what has been already noticed. The arguments also bear a similarity
to those subsequently adopted by General Lloyd, whose Treatise
I shall have a future occasion to quote.</p>

<p>If the subordinate arrangements of a ship could allow of it,
much benefit would ensue to the public service by a greater number
of Marine Soldiers being added to the complement of each, instead
of a set of men denominated <i>wasters</i>, who are partly composed of
criminals that have compromised with the injured laws of their
country, who rarely, even upon a stretch of years, become real
seamen, and who, from their former habits of life, are too often the
leaders of discord and insubordination.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if the plan which is suggested were generally
adopted, with such an additional force on board, capable of striking
terror upon either element, not a British squadron would put to sea
that must not be viewed by our enemies with a jealous eye; but
what would keep their extensive coasts for ever on the alert, and by
that rapidity and secrecy which are peculiar to all naval movements,
objects might be effected, and conquests achieved that never were
anticipated by the political surmises of our countrymen, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
intelligence of our foes. Many other weighty considerations might
also be adduced to enforce this expedient, which more properly fall
within discussion under a future detail of events.</p>

<p>At no period of time was ever the voice of the nation more unanimous
for war. The evidence of Captain Jenkins, before the House
of Commons, stating his sufferings from Spanish cruelty, aroused
the indignation of every member, and notwithstanding the pacific
temper of the Minister of that day, and his powerful influence, all
were anxious to vindicate the insulted honour of the nation.</p>

<p>Before the declaration of hostilities, Admiral Vernon sailed for
the West Indies, and arrived at Jamaica in the month of October,
1739. The aspect of public affairs previous to his leaving Europe,
fully sanctioned immediate enterprize against the enemy.</p>

<p>After taking in refreshments at Jamaica, and having embarked
200 Soldiers under Captain Newton, to serve as Marines, he shaped
his course for Porto Bello, the destined object of his attack, and
at that time the great mart for the wealthy commerce of Chili and
Peru.</p>

<p>The attempt was fraught with many apparent obstacles, but it was
undertaken and performed with an unexampled spirit and promptitude,
which are the surest means of success in military enterprize; but
more particularly when it is aimed against the distant territories of an
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the 21st of November, the attack was commenced by the
ships in line of battle, against the Iron Castle, a strong fort of 22
guns, at the north point of the entrance into the harbour. The
Spaniards flying from several parts of it, an instant debarkation of
the Seamen and Marines was resolved on, from the Burford, Norwich,
and Worcester, under cover of these ships. With the loss of only two
killed, they effected a landing, when they compensated for the want
of scaling ladders, by each man mounting upon the shoulders of
another, and thus entering the embrazures.&mdash;This Fort was carried
although no breach had been made, which indeed was almost impossible,
against walls of 9 feet in thickness, and such as afterwards
withstood for a while, the explosions of those mines that were used
to raze them.</p>

<p>This gallant beginning struck terror into the Garrison of Gloria
Castle, and Jeronimo Fort, both which defended the town; the
former had two regular bastions, and a curtain between them mounted
with 22 guns, besides many more pointing towards the mouth of the
harbour.</p>

<p>Upon the 22d, an attack was intended against the whole,
but the enemy hung out the white flag, a signal of surrender.
Upon this occasion, Captain Downing of the Navy led the attack
on the Iron Castle. After having landed, he very properly wished
to form his men into some order for it. One brave but impetuous
Sailor, disdaining such precautions, pushed on, who, on being ordered
to halt, answered with an ingenuous oath, "Don't let us halt,
Captain, till we are lamed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>In this operation we sustained a loss of only twenty killed and
wounded, while the enemy were lessened in their numbers by
desertions into the country, and by action, nearly three hundred
men.</p>

<p>After destroying the fortifications, which from their strength
required some time, the Admiral with his squadron sailed for Jamaica
upon the 13th of December, and previously received from the
Governor and inhabitants of the place the warmest acknowledgments
for the humanity and generous treatment they had experienced.</p>

<p>The bombardment of Carthagena, in February, 1740, and the
attack upon Chagre (a fort situate upon the mouth of a river of that
name, a little to the north-west of the Gulf of Darien), were all that
could be performed before the arrival of reinforcements and supplies
from Europe, now much wanted. The latter, surrendered, after a
contest with the men of war and bomb-ketches, upon the 24th of
March, when the Castle situated on a rock, and the Custom-house,
under its protection, were demolished and burnt. The fleet afterwards
returned to Porto Bello, and from thence to Jamaica.</p>

<p>At this period considerable exertions were making at home, with
a view to attack more effectually the Spanish possessions in South
America, as well as their own coasts.</p>

<p>A large number of men of war was assembled at Spithead, and
Lord Cathcart, with six regiments of Marines, now considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
strengthened, with other forces, were encamped in the Isle of Wight,
and continued in readiness for these intended services.</p>

<p>It was not until the 26th of October that the fleet set sail from
St. Helens for Jamaica, where they arrived in the month of January,
1741. The united forces which were embarked on board were
Wentworth's, Harrison's, and Cavendish's regiments of Foot, with
the six regiments of Marines already detailed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for his country, and that profession of which he
was so bright an ornament, Lord Cathcart very early fell a victim
to the climate, when the command devolved upon the Honourable
Brigadier General Wentworth.</p>

<p>The whole force sailed from Irish Bay, in Hispaniola, upon the
25th of February, 1741, consisting in all of one hundred and twenty-four
sail, having been reinforced by two of the Marine regiments
raised within the American provinces, and other levies which had
been previously formed in those colonies.</p>

<p>Upon the 4th of March, in the evening, the whole anchored
in the Grand Playa, to windward of the town of Carthagena, the
intended object of their attack.</p>

<p>After the necessary arrangements, the fleet moved forward in
two divisions, upon the 9th, to silence the different forts, as
preparatory to the landing of the troops. After little more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
one hour's cannonade, those of St. Jago and St. Philip were deserted
by the enemy, when five hundred grenadiers made a descent under
their walls, and took possession of them. Against the 15th, every
soldier, with the tents, tools, artillery, and ordnance stores were
landed, the ground was cleared, and an encampment formed.</p>

<p>About this time, the Admiral being informed by General Wentworth
that the army was much incommoded by a strong fascine
battery on the opposite side of the harbour, called the Barradera
side, he detached a number of boats, full of men, under the conduct
of Captain Boscawen, having under him Captains Laws and Coats,
of the navy.</p>

<p>Upon no occasion was intrepidity ever more conspicuous, and
that great man at this time gave an earnest of what his country
might expect from him. In their approach they did not observe
from its situation a small battery of five guns, but they soon remedied
their error, by resolutely pushing on shore, and gaining possession,
after a slight resistance.</p>

<p>The enemy rousing a little from their surprise at the other, consisting
of fifteen 24-pounders, opened their fire from two guns; but
following up the same spirited course, the seamen, headed by their
gallant leaders, advanced most rapidly, and carried this strong
battery also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Here they spiked up all the guns, destroyed the platforms, and
completely effected this important object with but little loss. The
enemy, well knowing the value of this position, soon mounted two
heavy cannon, which were again silenced by a ship ordered for that
purpose. A third opportunity&mdash;and the same scene of action afforded
a display of Naval courage, when six other guns were once more
destroyed, with every appendage to them.</p>

<p>These repeated efforts much aided the operations of the Army
now employed in the reduction of the Castle of Bocca Chica. Upon
the 25th of March, a practicable breach having been made in it,
the general communicated his determination to storm it. Accordingly
Admiral Vernon assembled all the boats, in order to co-operate,
having landed their men within view of the enemy, where the fascine
battery was fixed. This was a well-judged diversion; for when the
grenadiers advanced to storm, at the hour appointed, they met no
resistance, as the Spaniards fled without firing a shot.</p>

<p>A panic had now seized the enemy, who set fire to one of their
ships. Taking advantage of this state, the boats resolved to attempt
the fort of St. Joseph, which was immediately evacuated.</p>

<p>Being now within the boom thrown across the harbour, and the
Dons, seeming determined to sink their ships, they judged it proper
to row on, and soon boarded the Galicia, carrying the flag of
the Spanish Admiral.&mdash;These obstructions being removed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Admiral and the squadron, still with much difficulty, moved into
the harbour.</p>

<p>After various services, the Castle of Grande Castillo having
been gained, and the enemy sunk all their men of war, farther
preparations were made for landing the troops nearer the town, in
order to cut off all communication with the main land. Our loss,
up to the beginning of April, was two Colonels of Foot, one
of Marines, with one Captain of the Royal Navy, besides other
Officers slain, and upwards of four hundred of different descriptions
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>That mortality, which is the never-failing result of protracted
operations in this inhospitable clime, now began its ravages. Matters
were pushed on&mdash;the bomb-ketches on the 2d of April began to play
upon the town, and the other passages of approach cleared from the
ships sunk by the enemy, as being necessary for the disembarkation of
the forces near the city. After these difficulties were removed, they
were landed at the dawn of the 5th, under the command of General
Wentworth, who, after a spirited contest, established his encampment
within a mile of the fort of St. Lazar.&mdash;Things now drawing
to extremities, it became necessary to forego the ceremonies of a
regular siege, and, however hazardous, to rest the issue upon a storm.</p>

<p>Accordingly, before day-break on the 9th, five hundred Grenadiers,
supported by a thousand Marines, and some Jamaican levies,
advanced against the enemy's lines in front of the fort. These were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
distantly followed by a body of Americans, with wool-packs, scaling
ladders, and hand grenades.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were entrenched to the shoulders, and their
works over-awed by St. Lazar; but neither intimidated the gallant
progress of our men, who, led by Brigadier General Guise, were
much annoyed, suffering extremely from flanking fires, which
they had not foreseen, and enduring a heavy loss before they could
reach the object of their attack. The persevering and undaunted
bravery of British Soldiers was never more displayed than on this
day. They at last gained their point by intrepidly leaping
into the entrenchments, and driving their enemies into the fort,
which communicated by a draw-bridge with the lines.</p>

<p>It was now those gallant fellows felt the precipitate errors of their
superiors. The unarmed Americans in their rear, many of whom
were killed without possessing the powers of resistance, dispersed,
and threw away the charges committed to them. Three only did
their duty, and with these scanty supplies, a bold effort to scale the
walls of St. Lazar, was made by ten grenadiers, headed by a serjeant.&mdash;They
mounted them, but being unsupported, were all cut to pieces,
except him who saved himself by trusting his destinies to a headlong
adventure.</p>

<p>Cooped up within a narrow spot, exposed to the grapeshot and
marksmen of the enemy above them, the situation of these brave
remnants became desperate after the break of day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>A retreat was now the only expedient left, which was accomplished
under the countenance of a strong reinforcement from the
camp, but under the effects of a galling fire from the fort. The
Spaniards, however, did not dare to pursue a body of men, now
weakened by loss, but covered with glory. Nearly seven hundred
composed the list of killed and wounded upon this occasion.</p>

<p>The future operations of the army ceased to be offensive, and
their exertions necessarily became precautionary. Dissentions, with
their arising results, delay and disease, accomplished what the enemy
durst not attempt.</p>

<p>It belongs not to me to enlarge upon either causes or effects in
my limited detail, excepting where in either there may seem a
tendency to involve the military character of those men whose
memoirs and services I have undertaken to record. The Soldier
may appear as often distinguished amidst misfortune, as the Citizen,
though his country will render honours to the victorious alone,
like the world, which, too often, confines its incense to the prosperous.</p>

<p>It is a tribute due to the gallant subordinates of the fleet and
land force to say, that, throughout their arduous duties, they evinced
a courage and perseverance worthy of their country and their cause.
While history is bound to publish truths, it never ought to extenuate
the errors of any branches of its subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>By the 16th of April some hundreds became sick from exposure to
the weather, the heavy rains that periodically set in about this time,
and the scanty supplies of water; among whom were many of the
principal officers.</p>

<p>Upon the 23d and 24th, Councils of War were held, which
decided upon an immediate re-embarkation. Captain Knowles of
the Navy, who had throughout bore a distinguished part in the
duties of an Engineer, was now entrusted with the demolition of
Castillo Grande, which was with much labour completed on the 25th,
and all the guns rendered unserviceable. The same was effected
at Bocca Chica. Upon the whole, the Spaniards sustained a heavy
loss, as appears from the following detail:</p>

<p>Such events to the enemy were for some time irretrievable, and
long felt. The charges of repairing the different fortifications must
have been prodigious, when we consider the strength with which
they were constructed.</p>

<p>Our loss upon the whole was undoubtedly great, being in all
nearly two thousand men, and I annex a detail of the Officers of
European Corps who were killed, died of the diseases incident
to the climate, or of the wounds they received:</p>

<p>The casualties of the other auxiliaries which were drawn from
America, were not proportionate to the above, as they were better
calculated for the climate; but the regiments of Marines were
newly-raised levies, and by an erroneous policy, they were too
early destined for a country, the air of which alone will always outdo
the works of the sword.</p>

<p>It is remarked, that young formed Corps are the worst adapted

them, and are often strangers to that regulated system of

<p>At this time the whole Half-pay Establishment of Great Britain,
including Horse, Dragoons, Foot, Invalids, and Marines, consisted
of only five hundred and fifty-one Officers, and the annual expenditure
upon the whole was Â£34,492 10 0, being at the rate of
Â£94 10 0 per day, and so considerate and Åconomical were the
public measures, that the House of Commons addressed his Majesty,
praying, that those upon this list, if fit for service, might be appointed
to the first vacant commissions which occurred in the different
Regiments. But an ill-judged parsimony, as to the <i>number</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Officers attached to Corps, seemed also to exist, and the same spirit
was constantly urging the conversion of the Land Forces into bodies
of Marines.</p>

<p>The regulation for this establishment were nearly similar in
their principles to those framed for the line. The Colonels of
Marine Regiments clothed their respective Corps, and had the
liberty of recommending for commissions&mdash;Excepting that the whole
battalion was destined for a particular service, none of the Field
Officers were embarked. The greatest number of men on board the
largest ships did not exceed one hundred under a Captain, three
Subalterns, and the smallest was not less than twenty under an
Officer.</p>

<p>The Commanders of Marine detachments were enjoined to forward
<i>effective</i> returns of them every two months to the Commissary
General of Marines, attested by the Captains and Pursers of each.
This was necessary, in order to conduct the musters of the Regimental
Companies, and to guide the recruiting service on shore.
The same deductions were made from them as the Army, for
clothing and Chelsea Hospital, whether embarked or not.</p>

<p>When attached to any ship, their indulgencies were equal to
those of the Seamen, as to the receiving provisions without any
deductions from their pay on that account, they had short allowance
money, and the benefit of Naval Hospitals. When sent thither, either
sick or wounded, they were deemed effective in the musters ashore, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
producing a certificate from the Surgeon of the Ship to which they
belonged, and another from the Commanding Officer at head-quarters,
when in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Paymaster General of Marines issued the pay, upon receiving
it, to the Colonels of Regiments, or their Agents, and the Paymaster
of each settled all their accounts agreeably to the muster-rolls
they had from the Commissary General.</p>

<p>These muster-rolls, with the receipts of the different Colonels or
their Agents, were esteemed sufficient vouchers for passing the Paymaster's
accounts, and for making out warrants or debentures for
clearings; which terms shall undergo a more particular discussion,
under the head of Examples.</p>

<p>When brigaded abroad, they were paid exactly in the same
manner as the Army; but the arrears of Marine Officers were much
longer withheld, and the Captains of Companies were exposed to
very peculiar hardships, which will be stated more at length in a
subsequent stage of the narrative.&mdash;It is enough at present to remark,
that the Officers of these Regiments, when abroad, were often obliged
to assign that branch of their pay, at fifty per cent. discount, in order
to answer their temporary exigencies.</p>

<p>What a contrast does this system present to the reforms, which
have been recently established, in favour of this class of men.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">I</span>n consequence of the heavy losses sustained at Carthagena,
and the mortality which still continued to rage after their arrival
at Jamaica, the transit between the Regiments of Foot and Marines
was rapid and immediate. Upon this service promotions were
established by rotation in the whole line. Within the short period
of five weeks, the Corps, originally Douglas's, numbered amongst
its casualties, three Colonels, two Lieutenant Colonels, and two
Majors.</p>

<p>It was not until the beginning of July that the fleet and army
were in a state of readiness to renew their operations, when it was
resolved to proceed against the Island of Cuba, where they anchored
upon the 18th of July, in Walthenham Bay, immediately named Port
Cumberland, in honor of his Royal Highness the Duke, about
eighteen leagues to windward of St. Jago, the first object of their
intended attack, and properly speaking, the Capital, although it
was not then the seat of the Governor. The troops were all
landed upon the 24th, consisting nearly of four thousand men,
including one thousand chosen negroes, levied by the Island of
Jamaica, with a view to sustain the laborious duties of this service.
Having established a position upon the side of the river, nearly
three leagues from the mouth of the harbour, the General on the
25th pushed some detachments into the country, which every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
where beat back the outposts of the enemy, and in a few days
returned to the Camp, with plentiful supplies of provisions.</p>

<p>It was originally the intention of the Commanders in Chief to
have made a joint attack upon St. Jago, but the want of unanimity
which had sometime past, and now existed to a fatal degree, ruined
every purpose.&mdash;Contentious debates, and dilatory measures, took
place of cordial co-operation and pushing enterprize, while the
Country's interests and the lives of the Soldiery were daily sacrificed
to the bitterest feuds.</p>

<p>About the middle of August the General stated the impracticability
of advancing into the interior country with his present force,
and expressed a wish to await the arrival of fresh levies from
America, and the expected reinforcements from Europe, which now
became essential to complete the skeleton Corps of his Army.
The first resource was planned at the outset of the West India expedition,
and instructions had been early given to the Commander in
Chief to avail himself of it, when compelled by emergency.</p>

<p>Accordingly, recruiting parties were sent to New England to
raise volunteers, and General Wentworth, by a personal appeal to
the Governor of that province, urged the necessity of their being
seconded with public spirit and public liberality. Similar steps
were adopted in the State of New York, to fill up the American
Regiments of Marines; and the Governors, by an impressive address
to the Legislative Houses of both, strongly recommended their energies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
not only on the ground of patriotism, but of political expediency.
Bounties of forty shillings were offered to volunteers, and the alluring
inducements of conquered territory.&mdash;America then saw her interests in
the subjugation of the Spanish dependencies in that quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>During a long interval nothing was attempted, even towards a
partial reduction of Cuba, at the close of which, sickness, the
never-failing result of total inactivity in these climes, began his
ravages. It was therefore determined to evacuate the island, which
was effected upon the 20th of November, when the regimental returns
were as follow:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XI" id="CHAP_XI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XI.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">I</span>t was not until the 15th of January, 1742, that nearly three
thousand men, including two thousand Marines, arrived at Jamaica.
Another expedition was now meditated, which put to sea early in
March, but adverse winds, the separation of transports having on
board the working negroes, and the expectation of the periodical
rains now nearly setting in, suggested to a Council of War held at
Porto Bello, at the close of that month, the immediate return of the
whole armament, to the port they had left. This afforded another
instance of unfortunate discord. The fleet arrived at Jamaica upon
the 15th of May.</p>

<p>In order to give a specious appearance to things, and to compensate
for the national expenditures and past miscarriages, it was now
judged proper to detach a force to take possession of Rattan, an island
in the Bay of Honduras, and a situation highly proper for maintaining
a commercial intercourse with South America, as well as the trade
in logwood.</p>

<p>An establishment there having been formed early in the year, it
was determined in a Council of War to send a force of fifty Marines
and two hundred Americans, under Major Caulfield, in order to
place the island in a state of military defence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 23d of August, they reached Port Royal, on the south
side of it, where they formed a camp and erected Fort George to
defend the harbour, as well Fort Frederick, on the western part of it.
A great proportion of the American soldiers being papists, they formed
a plot to render the settlement abortive, and to rise upon the Marines
and the well-affected of their countrymen.</p>

<p>His Majesty's ship, Litchfield, then in the harbour, hearing the
alarm guns, instantly landed her party of Marines, who with those
on shore soon checked this daring mutiny, secured the delinquents,
and preserved the settlement to his Majesty.</p>

<p>Nothing farther was done during the inauspicious commands of
Admiral Vernon or General Wentworth, who both soon afterwards
returned to Great Britain, excepting the detaching five hundred men
of different descriptions to the aid of General Oglethorpe, in South
Carolina, and repelling the menaces of the Spaniards against the
infant colony of Georgia.</p>

<p>Orders of recall for both arrived at Jamaica upon the 23d of
September, and the General was directed to provide the fleet with a
number of commissioned Officers, and men, from the Marines, sufficient
to supply its wants; also to fill up the vacancies in the eight Independent
Companies raised for the defence of Jamaica. For the former
purpose, eleven hundred were required, which were nearly all that
were now left and fit for duty. The supernumerary Officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sick were sent home, and the American troops were invited to become
volunteers for both.</p>

<p>Government, under the experience of past disasters, now vested
the controul of the Marines in Sir Chaloner Ogle, upon whom the
naval command devolved after the departure of Admiral Vernon.
Notwithstanding the personal animosities that had existed, this Officer
bore his testimony to the zeal and distinguished bravery of the
Soldiery, whose gallant efforts and patient endurance under the
greatest privations, were uniformly conspicuous throughout a series of
misfortunes.</p>

<p>Upwards of seven thousand Marines and nearly four thousand of
other troops were the lamentable victims to pestilence and disunion,
but not to defeat. The objects which were accomplished, although not
adequate to their country's hopes, were still distressing to the enemy.
Their principal harbours were in a manner rendered defenceless,
and the Spanish government experienced much embarrassment from
nearly a total suspension of these pecuniary supplies, which could
alone enable it to maintain the war with vigour and effect, while
the distress pervaded every class of its subjects.</p>

<p>Our forces were ever after too feeble to undertake any enterprize
of importance against the enemy in that quarter of the world.&mdash;Self-defence
was now the system adopted by Sir Chaloner Ogle, as the
Spanish squadron at the Havannah was superior to his own, since
the departure of Admiral Vernon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The supplies which were voted for the year 1743 provided for a
large levy of Marines to fill up their casualties&mdash;eleven thousand
five hundred and fifty being the number decreed, and forty thousand
seamen.</p>

<p>Nothing further, consistent with my subject, appears on the face of
the public transactions of the year 1742.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XII" id="CHAP_XII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XII.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>arly in 1743, an impression upon some part of the continent
of South America being resolved on, the conduct of these operations
was entrusted to Captain Knowles, of the Navy, having on board
his squadron four hundred of the regiment of Dalzell, and about
six hundred Marines. They were first ordered to rendezvous at
Antigua, from which island they sailed upon the 12th of February,
with a view upon La Guira, a town in the district of the Caraccas,
in Terra Firma. The attack against it was commenced on the
18th, but owing to a very heavy swell, the men of war could not
approach the shore, and in consequence, the troops were not landed.&mdash;After
a very heavy cannonade, which was only ended by the night,
the ships withdrew from the combat. The town suffered extremely,
many breaches were made in the fortifications, and the enemy sustained
a loss of more than seven hundred men.</p>

<p>The Spaniards behaved well, as the squadron suffered very considerable
damages, besides having nearly four hundred killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>It proceeded to Curaccoa to refit, where they prepared for another
attempt upon the sea-coast of Terra Firma. Having been reinforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by some Dutch Volunteers, Commodore Knowles sailed from this
island upon the 20th of March, and shaped a course for Porto Cavallo,
where there was a respectable force, and a town in the best state of
defence.</p>

<p>Owing to strong lee currents, it was not until the 15th of April that
the ships anchored under the keys of Barbarat, to the eastward of the
place. Having reconnoitred the different points of opposition, which
were every where formidable, two ships were ordered upon the 16th
of April against Ponta Brava, to commence upon it a flanking fire,
which its low situation, and the injudicious construction of the works,
evidently permitted.</p>

<p>After they were silenced, it was agreed to land the troops of
every description, in order to take possession, and to turn the guns
against the Castle; their retreat being secured by a man of war
within pistol shot of the shore.&mdash;By sunset the ships had accomplished
their object, and by dark a force of twelve hundred sailors, soldiers,
and Dutch Volunteers were disembarked under the command of
Major Lucas.</p>

<p>About eleven at night the Van gained one of the fascine batteries
upon Ponta Brava, when a Spanish centinel discharged his musquet,
and gave a general alarm.</p>

<p>Two guns being fired from the other battery, which was the next
for capture, put into an unaccountable confusion nearly the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
this mixed detachment, when under the influence of a panic they
retreated to the ships with precipitation.</p>

<p>Upon the 21st it was resolved to wipe away the disgrace of the
late miscarriage, by an attack of the squadron and forces against the
Castle and fascine batteries.&mdash;Four ships were destined to batter the
former upon the 24th, while three others were placed against the
latter. The cannonading began at eleven on the noon of that day,
and was maintained with a mutual obstinacy till nine at night, when
after a short interval the firing was renewed. Some of the ships
having now expended all their ammunition, and others being damaged,
they were ordered to slip, and to anchor without the reach of the
enemy's shot.</p>

<p>This attack being fruitless in its object, which was to land the
troops, and fatal in its consequences, by a loss of more than two
hundred men, it was now deemed impracticable to push any farther
enterprize, and upon the 28th, in a general consultation, it was
resolved to return to Jamaica.</p>

<p>The extended operations of our fleets in other quarters being
marked with no events in which his Majesty's Marine forces were
particularly called forth, no farther details connected with my narrative
appear within the annals of 1743.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIII" id="CHAP_XIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">A</span>lthough Great Britain, as a guarantee of the balance of
continental power, had, during a past period, exerted her resources
in the cause of her Allies, opposed to the interests of France, although
his Majesty King George the Second, in quality of Elector of Hanover,
had been highly distinguished in the field at the head of these armies,
still a specious cordiality continued to exist between the two
nations.</p>

<p>Since the declaration of hostilities against Spain, our restless and
intriguing neighbours enjoyed all the advantages of war, without
experiencing any of its evils.</p>

<p>At the outset of this year, however, their projects were developed
by the equipment of powerful naval armaments in their ports, and the
assembling of armies upon their sea-coasts; the avowed aim of which
was against the Crown and Liberties of the British Empire.</p>

<p>A Prince, delegated by his Father, and drawn from his retreat in
another country, mild in his temper, and amiable in his manners, was
induced to renew their almost forgotten claims upon our monarchy,
and to revive the quickly decaying prejudices within our land, in
favour of his family and himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Unable now no longer to restrain her views, France declared
war upon the 20th day of March, which was answered by a
similar proclamation of the 31st, on the part of England.&mdash;That
Providence which has often so signally interposed for our
country was now conspicuous.&mdash;The elements were employed
in the destruction of many of their transports and troops at Dunkirk,
while our floating bulwarks chased their covering fleet from
our coasts.</p>

<p>At this time the whole property of naval prizes was vested in
the captors, his Majesty having generously relinquished that share
which hitherto had pertained to the Crown.</p>

<p>The arrival of Commodore Anson from his expedition, which
was originally intended to co-operate across the isthmus of Darien,
with the fatal one conducted by Admiral Vernon, diffused a joy
into the nation.</p>

<p>The specie which was gained by his enterprize, courage, and perseverance
was immense; and although it was obtained antecedent to
the royal grant, still it was divided amongst his squadron, unimpaired
by claims.</p>

<p>About three hundred and thirty marines shared in the toils, and
the many debarkations which took place in his tedious progress;
having been drafted from the different regiments to fill up the
complement of his ships, and to supply the place of a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Invalids under Lieutenant Colonel Cracherode, who dreading their
approaching hardships, deserted from the service.</p>

<p>Fleets were now detached to every quarter of the globe, and
a force of eleven thousand five hundred and fifty-six Marines, was
again the establishment of 1744.</p>

<p>It falls not within my scope to enlarge upon the wide and
mingled events of this year. A partial affair in the month of May,
occurred in the Mediterranean, in which the party of Marines
disembarked from the Essex signalized themselves. That ship being
on a cruize, gained sight of twenty-six Xebeques and Settees, bound
to Antibes, from whence they were to carry troops to Italy. The
former were a convoy to the latter, which were laden with powder,
cannon, ordnance stores, and provisions. Thirteen having taken
refuge in the Creek of Cassi, the Marines were landed in order to
co-operate with the boats, and to repel any enemy that might appear
to retard their progress. They were soon attacked by a body of
Spaniards, whom they beat back, and thus effected the object on
which they were employed. Eleven vessels were burnt and two
captured, which was a material loss in its consequences.</p>

<p>Nothing further, that properly falls within my notice, appears
within the period of this year: our numerous cruizers were peculiarly
successful, and although few traits of achievement appear on the face
of our public transactions during this limited era, still both the nation
and the individual felt the benefit and the incitement that resulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from the liberal sacrifice recently made by their Sovereign, which,
while it promoted a general activity and zeal amongst every class
of his subjects, struck deep also into the commercial vitals of our
enemies.</p>

<p>The ten Regiments of Marines, by order of the Secretary at War,
were directed to recruit with expedition, and in order to render them
speedily effective, a number of impressed men were allotted to each.
This expedient was also adopted with regard to many Regiments of
Infantry.</p>

<p>In the Bill for the more easily recruiting his Majesty's Land
Forces and Marines, a clause was inserted, that every one who
should enter voluntarily would be entitled to a bounty of four pounds,
and might require his discharge from the service at the expiration of
three years.</p>

<p>The Parliament met upon the 27th of November, and granted
a vote of Â£206,253 15 0 to support an establishment of eleven
thousand five hundred and fifty Marines during the ensuing twelve
months.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIV" id="CHAP_XIV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">S</span>ome inferior attacks having been made, during the last year,
by the Governor of Cape Breton upon Canso and Annapolis, in
Nova Scotia, the former of which places was burnt by the French,
the Northern Colonies of British America became alarmed for their
safety. Roused by the representations and the united patriotism
of Mr. Achmuty, Judge of the Admiralty Court, in New England,
and Mr. Vaughan, an individual of great fortune and public spirit,
they commenced preparations for an expedition against Louisburg.
Accordingly considerable levies were begun, and a co-operating
naval force was requested by Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts Bay,
from his Majesty's Ministers.</p>

<p>At this time Commodore Warren commanded upon the West
India station, who was ordered to repair to Canso with that view.
A meritorious secrecy prevailed throughout, which half secured the
success of an attempt that, considering the strong means of defence
possessed by the enemy, and the inexperienced troops employed
against them, was extremely doubtful. The activity of the Americans
upon this occasion, was fully equal to the important interests they had
at stake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the 4th of April the levies from New England reached
Canso, and were encamped there, where they were improved in
their discipline until the arrival of the other troops from the different
Provinces, while the ships of war upon the coast, and some stout
privateers, continued off the harbour of Louisburg, in order to cut
off all supplies, as well as intelligence of the projected enterprize.</p>

<p>Upon the 23d of April, Commodore Warren arrived at Canso,
and against the 29th all the land forces were embarked, when
they proceeded for Gabarus Bay, about four miles from the capital
of Cape Breton.</p>

<p>Upon the 30th two thousand men were landed at noon, who
beat back a respectable force which was detached to prevent their
descent. Upon that and the following day the rest were disembarked
along with nearly three hundred Seamen, and five hundred Marines,
under cover of the privateers and some smaller vessels ranged along
the shore. The whole was under the command of General Pepperel,
a native of Piscataway.</p>

<p>The French, proudly conscious of their strength, were exposed
to surprise from this cause. It is but justice to an enemy, and it
affords an impressive example to the military servants of every State, to
remark an instance of fidelity in the private Soldiery of the garrison,
at this critical moment. Long employed in carrying on the extensive
works of Louisburg, without any recompence, which, however,
was granted by their Government, but alienated from them by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Officers, they had been in a state of insubordination and discontent,
little short of mutiny, nearly six months, until the appearance of
our forces, when Patriotism cancelled all inferior grievances, and
these brave men now only recognized the duties of zeal and allegiance
to their Sovereign and their Country. In a body they requested to
be led against the invaders, but suspicion and distrust restrained
their superiors from availing themselves of the tender. The spirit
was allowed to subside, and perhaps an occasion was lost of averting
their approaching destinies.</p>

<p>After the disembarkation of our troops, they were pushed on
and formed two separate encampments; one on the southern part
of the harbour to attack the City, and the other upon the northern
side against the Grand Battery.</p>

<p>Upon the night of the 1st of May our outscouts, in the latter direction,
set fire to some storehouses full of combustibles, which burnt so
awfully that the French within this important post became panic
struck, and conceiving that the whole British force was advancing,
retreated precipitately into the City. The works were possessed in
the morning by only thirteen men, who were soon reinforced, when
an unavailing attack was made by the enemy to recover them.</p>

<p>They had done their utmost to render all the cannon unserviceable,
which required some time before they could be drilled and fit for use;
during which a most tremendous fire was opened upon this spot from
the guns and mortars upon the Island Battery, and the Town, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with little success. Within a few days they both experienced the
effects of this post being in our hands, in the loss of men, and the
demolition of houses.</p>

<p>The force on the north side of the harbour were not idle, but
had pushed their approaches within two hundred yards of the City,
by the 12th of May, which they continued to cannonade, with great
vigour and success, from some heavy guns planted on an eminence
called the Green Hill, and a fascine battery of twenty eight.</p>

<p>The business of the siege was carried on under the greatest
difficulties, with an unsurpassed alacrity by all. No class could here
claim any pre-eminent merit, for every one was guided by one
uniform impulse.</p>

<p>The walls and embrasures of what the French entitled the
Circular Battery, were soon destroyed, and every thing went on well.
Some important captures, which accelerated the fall of Cape Breton,
were made by our blockading squadron.</p>

<p>It being necessary to push matters as quickly as possible, an
attempt upon the Island Battery was ordered, as it very materially
incommoded our operations on the north side, and prevented the
entrance of our ships into the harbour.</p>

<p>A force of two hundred Marines, and three hundred Americans,
was appointed for this service, and about twelve at night, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
23d of May, the whole proceeded on that duty. Soon after a heavy
fog came on that prevented their landing from the whale boats, and
which obliged them to draw off; although they were not unheard
by the enemy's garrison, which then consisted of only fourteen men,
to whom this afforded a timely hint for their reinforcing so material
a post with three hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>Upon the 27th, at two in the morning, this enterprize was renewed
by one hundred and fifty Marines and nearly two hundred Provincials.
The French, discovering their approach, fired grapeshot from their
heavy guns, which destroyed some boats with the soldiers, when our
troops gallantly pushed ashore.</p>

<p>Until sunrise they persevered in the daring but unequal contest;
when at last, reduced numbers, and walls which they in vain
attempted to scale, obliged them to call for quarter.</p>

<p>By indefatigable labour, however, on the night of the 1st of June,
a commanding situation upon the cliff, which swept the platform of
the Island Battery, and the entrance into the harbour, was completed,
and cannon were planted in it. Things now drew to a crisis;
every subordinate event combined to prosper an undertaking founded
in a judicious policy, and conducted with an unanimous zeal. After
forty-nine days of unrelaxed exertion, Louisburg capitulated, and
with it the whole Dependency of Cape Breton.&mdash;This object was
accomplished with the loss of little more than one hundred men,
while that of the French exceeded three hundred. The greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
part fell on the Marines in the attempt upon the Island Battery, who
shared in the success and glory of that expedition, and in the general
tribute of applause which was so justly conferred upon all&mdash;by their
Country.</p>

<p>The domestic events of the present year were marked by so
peculiar an interest, that I cannot pass them without notice.&mdash;The
adverse circumstances which occurred early in 1744 had only suspended,
but did not annihilate the hopes of Prince Charles Edward,
the eldest son of the Pretender, to re-ascend the throne of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>Guided by desperate and designing men, urged on by the wily
politics of France, which wished him success, but would not afford
the means of it, and personally sanguine in his disposition, he readily
listened to every representation that flattered his views. He accordingly
embarked his destinies in a stile little adequate to the extent of
his designs, which were to dethrone a beloved Sovereign, and to
overturn the Constitution of a brave and a free People.</p>

<p>It is not for me to follow him in the range of his efforts, or to
detail the successes which for a while attended his steps.</p>

<p>Britons, little accustomed to hear the sound of war at their own
gates, were at first alarmed at the novelty, but they soon evinced both
loyalty and union in sustaining the fixed rights of their Monarch,
and in defending their own liberties.&mdash;Party became dumb, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
addresses, backed by associations were the tenders daily made to
their King.</p>

<p>It was reserved for a branch of that House which he came to
destroy, to vindicate its claims and its honor. His Royal Highness
the Duke of Cumberland, by the Battle of Culloden, not only put a
close to the Rebellion, but for ever ended the aspiring hopes of the
family of the Stuarts; the remains of which have survived to exist
upon the bounty of a Prince whose throne they had striven to
subvert.</p>

<p>The events of a short day transformed Charles from an imaginary
Monarch to a humble beggar, and he would fain have quickly retraced
his steps to that shore, upon which he had landed with such elated prospects.
But many sufferings and hardships were yet in store; an
interval which has immortalized the character of those poor but
virtuous natives amongst whom he flew for refuge.</p>

<p>Although a reward Â£30,000 was the boon offered for his person,
and he constantly within the power of the meanest, still an Iscariot,
was not to be found. Adversity, that hour in which true friends
can best be recognized, shewed him human nature in its most exalted
form, in a people, though depressed by penury, that would not sacrifice
either him or his cause.&mdash;Every loyal man, while he must deprecate
<i>the aim</i>, will still applaud <i>the principle</i> of their actions. The illiterate
tenants of the Hebrides have transmitted an example of fidelity and allegiance
worthy of being known and imitated by the subjects of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
realm. The unfortunate Prince found his way to France, and while
time has extinguished his family, it has also subverted prejudices, and
has incorporated all his adherents with the united strength of the
Empire.</p>

<p>Although the incidents to which I have thus recurred have no
connexion with my subject, still the <i>inferences</i> that arise from them,
as well as the critical occasion, I trust, will sanction their insertion
and this digression.</p>

<p>The following was the list and effective strength of the Marine
Regiments in 1745:</p>

<p class="noindent">Besides 1,550 Commissioned and Non-commissioned Officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time, and indeed since their institution in 1739, Commissions
were purchased and sold in the Regiments of Marines,
although they always bore an inferior value to these in Old Corps.
A perquisite frequently arose to the Colonels from the disposal of
Second Lieutenancies, when his Majesty was pleased to accept of
their recommendation. Such usually produced from Â£250 to Â£280,
while Ensigncies in the Line sometimes yielded Â£400.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XV" id="CHAP_XV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XV.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>arly in 1746, a Committee was appointed to investigate the
state and grievances of the Land Forces and Marines. A considerable
increase of expence had accrued in the maintenance of
both, which was one of the objects of this inquiry. Such as affected
the Marine Regiments I have already detailed, and assigned the
causes of the additional charges in this establishment since the
peace of Utrecht. The same are applicable to the Army at large,
in the allowance which was made to Commission-Officers in lieu of
servants, in 1713, in a similar indulgence granted to the Quartermasters
in marching Regiments in 1718, and the annuities to
Officers Widows, to Colonels for clothing lost by deserters, to
Captains for recruiting, and to the Agents of Corps, which were all
the newly-adopted establishments of the latter year.</p>

<p>These additional grants, while they meliorated the situation of
the Officer, cost the Nation but little.</p>

<p>It appears, in the course of this inquiry, that the perquisites of
a Colonel, in clothing a Marine Regiment, exceeded those of the
Foot, from the comparative superiority in their numbers, and the
articles being of an inferior quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The grievances which had existed, and were <i>peculiar</i> to those
Regiments, appeared conspicuous in the course of this public
research.</p>

<p>"Upon the whole business, witnesses were examined by the
Committee who deposed that the Marines, while on the West
India expedition, were paid according to the returns of effective
men made monthly to the Commander in Chief, and the account
of the <i>off-reckonings</i> was kept by the Pay-Office; and that the
Officers <i>clearings</i> of the first raised six Regiments had been paid
<i>only</i> to the 25th of December, 1740, and of the other four to the
24th of June, 1741, <i>of which</i> the Pay-Master cannot <i>now</i> make
any demand, till muster-rolls are delivered into his office, which
he must compute, and then certify a state of the Regiment's
account to the Secretary at War, who lays it before the King;
in consequence of which, <i>warrants</i> for <i>clearing</i> the Regiment
are issued to the Pay-master, who then makes out <i>debentures</i>,
pursuant to which a <i>warrant</i> is drawn for the payment of the
money, and that by this was to be understood <i>clearing</i> the
Regiment. It further appeared, that by the usage of the Army,
Regiments could not be <i>cleared</i> with till muster-rolls were made
out, but that the Marines had never been regularly mustered,
(owing to their being detached and employed in every quarter of the
globe) to which circumstance is owing their not having been
cleared with, which has been a sad inconvenience to many of the
Officers who were obliged to assign their arrears at a prodigious
discount."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the Agents, upon his evidence, suggested to the Committee
an expedient, by which to remedy this evil, which was,
that muster-rolls might be made up from the books of the Men of
War already come home, and from the muster-rolls of the men now
at quarters. He additionally submitted it as his opinion, that it was
the <i>duty</i> of the <i>Commissary</i> to make up this account, and <i>within his
instructions</i>, to accept of such books as immediate vouchers. This
Gentleman farther certified, that the <i>off reckonings</i> were regularly
paid, but that the <i>clearings</i> were not, and that the Colonel usually
saved near Â£1,000 out the <i>off reckonings</i>, after clothing a Marine
Regiment; and he conceived, that the Officers <i>clearings</i> might also
be paid by a <i>warrant</i> from the King to the Secretary at War;
more particularly as there was no deficiency of Officers, though
there might be of Private men; and the returns made being strictly
upon honor, might supply the want of muster-rolls.</p>

<p>From another witness it was obvious, that no account had ever
been settled with the Captains of Marines for their Companies, the
Agents always alleging, that it could not be done without muster-rolls;
and that though the Marines, when in the West Indies, were
mustered and paid in the same manner as the marching Regiments
were; and though the latter were cleared when they came home,
<i>yet the former were not</i>.</p>

<p>That in the summer of 1745, indeed, a warranty countersigned
by the Secretary at War, was sent to the Pay-Master for <i>clearing</i>
the four last raised Regiments of Marines, notwithstanding the want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of muster-rolls; but not being signed by the Lords of the Treasury,
it was not attended to.</p>

<p>This hardship was <i>peculiar</i> to the Marine Regiments, as it
became evident to the Gentlemen forming the Committee of Inquiry,
that the different Corps of Foot employed upon the same service had
been <i>cleared</i> by such authority countersigned by the Secretary at War
alone, without any objection, though the pay had been issued in the
same manner to them, and the want of muster-rolls equally their
case.</p>

<p>Marine Officers, it appeared, were not allowed to take their
servants, when ordered to embark.</p>

<p>At this period, there was a sum of Â£101,551 3 4 in the hands
of the Pay-Master of Marines; the amount of the above-mentioned
claims, whose character and motives, however, were clearly exculpated
from any blame; but it was not so with his Deputy or Cashier, who
had appropriated near Â£90,000, bearing interest upon land-tax tallies,
East India Bonds, and clothing assignments, <i>without the knowledge of
his Superior</i>, who had been informed, and till this investigation took
place, always understood that the whole had been deposited in the
Bank of England.</p>

<p>Another Subordinate, the Accountant of the Pay-Master, shared
in the annual profits of these investments, which were derived from
the invaded rights of the injured Officer.&mdash;After having divided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
spoils during some years, and having made a restitution of the principal,
they were both deprived of their situations.</p>

<p>Such a scene of grievance appeared through the whole of this
scrutiny, that the Committee emphatically closed their report, by
the ingenuous avowal, that the <i>facts</i> which appeared called for public
notice, and highly deserved the attention of Parliament.</p>

<p>It ought to be related, to the honour of these suffering Corps,
that during the long period of nearly six years they suppressed
their feelings until the present occasion, of which they very properly
availed themselves.</p>

<p>They now submitted their wrongs to a Board, instituted by legislative
sanction, and for the express purpose of redress, as well as of
inquiry; the following are the terms in which the Memorial of one
of the Marine Regiments were couched:</p>

<p class="negidt1 pad4">To the Gentlemen of the Committee, and which may be
considered as engrossing the general sentiments of the
whole that were employed in the Expedition to the West
Indies.</p>

<p>1st. "That in the month of August, 1740, when <i>this</i> regiment
was one of those embarked for the expedition to the West Indies,
the Captains were obliged by <i>order</i>, out of their own pockets, to
provide and lay in a stock of sugar, tobacco, snuff, shirts, shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
stockings, jackets, trowzers, and other sea stores, for the use of
their Companies; and were considerable losers in the waste and
weighing, and in the division of the several species to the men;
that farther, if any man died (which was frequently the case,)
who had not lived long enough to pay the charge of their slops,
the Captain was the only sufferer, as he received his mens' subsistence
<i>according to the effective monthly returns only</i>, by order of
the General; nay, the ordinary allowance of the two Warrant
Men, paid in Great Britain and Ireland monthly to the Captains,
with their subsistence, was here deducted, notwithstanding they
embarked complete.</p>

<p>2dly. "The exchange of money between England and Jamaica,
at that time was 40 per cent. and money enough to be had
at that exchange for the payment of the Army; nevertheless the
Officers and Private Men on that expedition were obliged to
receive their pay at 20 per cent. for some time: indeed, upon a
general murmur made by the army upon that occasion, there was
5 per cent. more added; so here was still a deduction of 15 per
cent. A noted instance of this severity at the end.</p>

<p>3dly. "The Agents <i>now</i> deny making up their accounts with
the Captains of Marines, in the same manner that other Captains
are accounted with; and in short deny giving any accounts at
all. By this means a good deal of that martial dependence a
Soldier ought to have on his Officer is withdrawn, as he finds
the Agent is his factotum in affairs of money, and his executor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in case he dies. The Agents, in order to support these their unjust
proceedings, endeavour to screen themselves under some wrested
paragraphs in the Mutiny Act; for (as we apprehend), from the
Legislatures designed intent, and quite contrary to the King's
Order in his Articles of War, <i>which must always be consequent to
the above act</i>, as by the said act it is, that his Majesty is
empowered to make such orders or articles.</p>

<p>4thly. "The Officers of Marines are by the same terms of
chicanery kept from receiving their arrears, there being five
years and a half due the 24th of June of the present year
(1746), notwithstanding the other parts of the Army receive
them punctually, though in no part of the service ought the
arrears to be quicker paid than in the Marines, where Officers
are put to certain and immediate necessary expences on every
embarkation.</p>

<p>5thly. "It is plainly evident that no Officer in the Marine
service (whilst dealt and accounted with in this manner), enjoys
the same privileges with the other Officers of the Army, which
must of consequence create heart-burnings, to the detriment of the
service. Seeing, therefore, that these Officers have (notwithstanding
their cruel usage) on all occasions and at all times been most ready
with their lives and abilities to devote themselves to the service of
their King and Country, we humbly beg that this their situation
may be inquired into."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The instance which was referred to from the 2d article is as
follow:</p>

<p>"A Pay-Master, while the Marines were employed in the Island
of Cuba, by order of his Commanding Officer, did receive between
3 and Â£400 of the deceased Officers money, for which he gave
bills upon the Agent of the Regiment in London, and issued out
this money to the Officers, on account of their subsistence at the
full exchange, which they were in great need of.</p>

<p>"When this Pay-Master was in the course of passing his
accounts with the Agent of the Regiment, he was told that the
Pay-Master General would not allow him this money, because
all money on account of the Regiment (a scheme of which
the Pay-Master knew nothing) <i>was to be drawn from the
Contractors</i>, that is, the Marines were to receive their subsistence
at 15 per cent. less than the currency of the country; though
God knows, and the world are competent judges of the hardships
and severities of campaigning in such a climate with sea
provisions only, and bad water; besides, it was utterly impossible
for men thus curtailed of their small subsistence, to purchase the
least refreshments, when it is considered that a poor sheep was sold
for Â£4, a turkey at Â£1 3 9, and so in proportion for every thing
that could be termed fresh provisions.</p>

<p>"In return for such sufferings, the few who remained alive to
revisit their native country, with the entail of broken constitutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
scarcely worth the enjoying, which they still dragged on in the
solacing hope of all their sorrows being closed, and all their
claims adjusted, in order to restore their health, and to render
them once more fit for the service of their King and Country, to
their great disappointment, are to this very day kept (we believe)
by the juggling tricks of the Pay-Master General, and the Agents,
from their arrears, <i>and the small benefits allowed to other parts of the
Army</i>.</p>

<p>"From the beginning of this example it is plain, that no
charitable regard was to be paid to the executors of deceased Officers
receiving their money at par in Great Britain, nor to the sufferings
of Officers in America, who received this small sum on the same
terms there for subsistence. We therefore most humbly pray your
goodness to intercede with his Majesty for the relief of these our
grievances."</p>

<p>Such are the details of privation which this meritorious body had
long continued to endure in silent loyalty. Thus early did they afford
the brightest examples of steady allegiance, which has transcended
to their posterity under every change of constitution they have undergone,
and what, I trust, will ever be the distinguishing characteristic
of a British Marine, under all the destinies of himself or his
country.</p>

<p>One resulting and immediate consequence of this public inquiry
was, that the Pay-Master made good the balance in his hands, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was lodged in the bank of England for the future benefit of those
who were so justly entitled to it.</p>

<p>Having introduced, in the preceding part of this inquiry, some
terms which may not be understood by all, I shall take a retrospect
of each, and define them in rotation.</p>

<p>The first that occurs is <i>off-reckonings</i>&mdash;of these there are two kinds,
<i>gross</i> and <i>nett</i> off-reckonings; the former consisted of all the pay of
the Non-commission Officers and Private Men <i>above</i> their subsistence:
for instance, during the period to which I allude, the <i>full pay</i> of
a common Soldier was 8<i>d.</i> per day, out of which 2<i>d.</i> was stopped
for clothes, &amp;c. and 6<i>d.</i> remained for his subsistence. From this
too, 6<i>d.</i> per week was deducted to furnish stockings and shoes when
the regimental articles were worn out.</p>

<p>The Captain of each Company always settled with his men for
the balance, if any, every two months. <i>Nett off-reckonings</i> were
the amount of the <i>gross off-reckonings</i>, reserved for the purpose of
clothing the men, <i>after</i> the deductions of 1<i>s.</i> in the pound, and one
day's pay from each Regiment, for the benefit of Chelsea Hospital,
with 2<i>d.</i> in the pound for the agent of each Corps.&mdash;Such stoppages
were always made at the Pay-Office.</p>

<p><i>Clearings</i> were the balance of each Officer's pay <i>above</i> his subsistence,
after the deductions stated were made, which ought to have been regularly
paid by the Pay-Master General to the different Marine Agents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warrants</i> were documents with the sign-manual attached to each
which authorized the receipt, and disbursements of money from the
Treasury. They may be considered as the <i>sanctions</i> of any Board.
<i>Debentures</i> were commonly made up at the Pay-Office, by virtue of
warrants from the War-Office, annexing a general statement of the
charges of each Regiment, upon which proceeded a <i>final</i> or clearing
warrant. Debentures originated in 1649, and they were a mode
in the form of a bond, or bill, by which Government obliged itself
to render payments of such monies as might be due to the Soldier,
or his assigns, upon examining and closing the account of his
arrears.</p>

<p>Nearly twelve thousand Marines was the vote of 1746. Early
in this year, an expedition was meditated against Quebec, and a
considerable force assembled at Spithead for that intent, amongst
which was Colonel Powlet's Regiment of Marines; but from
unaccountable delays, there the whole remained until the season was
too late for such an attempt.</p>

<p>They were afterwards destined against Port L'Orient, with a
view to distress the French East India Company, as well as to create
a diversion in favour of the Austrian operations in Provence. The
Commanders appointed were Admiral Lestock and Lieutenant General
Sinclair.</p>

<p>The long detention of so respectable a force, until the period of
Equinox not only gave time for the enemy to ascertain its object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
but endangered its progress along a hostile coast, at so very critical
a season.</p>

<p>At last, having assembled at Plymouth, the whole set sail upon
the 14th of September, steering directly for the coast of Britanny.&mdash;Five
thousand Infantry to be strengthened, if necessary, by the Marines
of sixteen Sail of the Line, and eight Frigates, were the number
employed on this occasion.</p>

<p>They made the coast upon the 18th; but from adverse circumstances,
a debarkation was not effected until the 20th. The interval
was advantageous for the enemy, who by alarm guns during the
day, and lighted fire-beacons upon the tops of corresponding hills
during the night, soon apprised their distant countrymen of an
invader's approach.</p>

<p>It was in vain that opposition was attempted against the
descent of our troops, by a body of undisciplined Militia. After
having landed the cannon, with the ammunition and stores, in
Quimparley-Bay, the whole were left under the charge of a
small party of the Royal Artillery, and a body of one hundred
Marines.</p>

<p>On the 21st the army advanced in two columns against Plymeur,
which they reached after some slight skirmishing. The place having
agreed to surrender, but afterwards treacherously firing upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
detachment, it was given up to plunder. On the following day, the
whole moved on to a rising ground within a mile of Port L'Orient, the
ultimate object of their views. After a fruitless parley, which the
French had established, in order to gain time and to collect
their scattered means of defence, hostilities commenced on the 24th.</p>

<p>Some affairs took place between that and the 26th, when after a
cannonade, which did considerable damage to the town, a retreat
was commenced under cover of the night.</p>

<p>The French were now pouring from all quarters, and the situation
of our forces became critical. The fatigues endured by our men
of every description were excessive. The opportunity of conquest
seems to have been lost in the want of early energies, which allowed
a valuable interval to the enemy for defence.</p>

<p>After a loss of about one hundred and fifty killed, wounded, and
missing, and some Artillery, the re-embarkation was effected, when
the fleet set sail upon the 1st of October, for the Bay of Borneuff,
off Quiberon, and to the South of Quimperlay.</p>

<p>The body of Marines I have mentioned, were intrenched at
Quimperlay, to guard the landing-place, and the rest, under Colonel
Holmes, were united with the Army.</p>

<p>Upon the 4th of October, some troops were landed on the
peninsula of Quiberon, without opposition, from whence the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
had fled with all their effects. After remaining ashore some days,
the whole returned to England, without having effected any thing
during that time, worthy of remark.</p>

<p>Nothing of moment appears farther on the face of the military
operations of the present year, in which the Marines had a share.</p>

<p>In the gradual increase to the Establishment of the Army during
the present war, the Marines became incorporated with the Line,
and their numerical precedence commenced with the 44th Regiment,
entitled, The First Marines.</p>

<p>The following is the detail of the Field Officers and Agents of
each Corps, all of which were quartered in Great Britain, and in the
vicinity of the principal sea-ports, at the close of the present year.</p>

<p>These Regiments, when complete, were supposed to consist of
one thousand Rank and File each, and every battalion of ten
Companies.</p>

<p>At this period the whole forces upon the British Establishment
amounted to eighty-five thousand six hundred and eleven
men.</p>

<p>As institutions of honor, and distinctions of merit, are necessary
incentives for animating the zeal both of Corps and individuals, as
like every other inheritance, peculiar privileges ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
transmitted, unimpaired, to the lineal successors of Public Bodies, if
not forfeited by misconduct, or abused by wantonness, I am thus
led to remark an occurrence that took place in London, and which
is authenticated by Major Donkin, in his "Military Collections," who
was a cotemporary and intimate with the Officer to whom the
circumstance happened. It is thus expressed:</p>

<p>"<i>The 3d Regiment of Foot, raised in</i> 1665, known by the ancient
title of The Old Buffs, have the privilege of marching through
London with drums beating, colours flying! which the city
disputes not only with all other Corps, but even with the King's
Guards going on duty to the Tower! It happened in the year
1746, that as a detachment of Marines were beating along
Cheapside, one of the Magistrates came up to the Officer, requiring
him to cease the drum, as no Soldiers were allowed to interrupt
the civil repose. The Captain commanding (an intimate friend
of mine) immediately said, Sir, we are Marines.&mdash;Oh, Sir! replied
the Alderman, I beg pardon; I did not know it! Pray continue
your route as you please."</p>

<p>It has been already noticed in the early part of this retrospect,
that the Corps of Marines was originally engrafted upon <i>that Regiment</i>
to which the Major alludes&mdash;that the <i>Old Buffs</i> of the present day
gained one numerical step in the Line, from the extinction of its
predecessor, previous to which circumstance it had no claim to the
privilege in question, and could establish no subsequent one from
merely a sameness in name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The conclusion which naturally arises must be, that after having
ascertained <i>our First Parent, as children</i>, we should enjoy unalienated
the honors of our forefathers.&mdash;Whether or not, in authenticating the
fact he has stated, the Major means to advance a similar inference
by a like train of analogy, I know not, but it appears to carry a
feasible construction.</p>

<p>Although the metropolis is but rarely the scene of our service,
except that of recruiting, still no one can anticipate the reforms which
may be judged necessary in the different military establishments of our
Country. In adducing one example of undisputed right, it must
certainly fix it as a recognized principle under all future contingencies,
excepting that the laws of police shall have utterly
abolished the practice.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVI" id="CHAP_XVI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>leven thousand one hundred and fifty Marines constituted the
vote for 1747.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the disasters of the last year in a projected
expedition under Duke D'Anville, against Cape Breton, still the
ministry of France persevered in their designs upon that important
possession. Another object, more extensive in its nature and more
fatal in its aim, formed also a part of their plan in the subsequent
operations of the war, which was directed against the British
dependencies upon the Coast of Coromandel.</p>

<p>These armaments equipped, under different destinations, set sail
from France in united force, under the fond persuasion that no hostile
interruption could stop their progress.</p>

<p>A happy genius appeared at this time to guide our Naval Councils.
Early intelligence was obtained of the enemy's views, and adequate
measures were soon taken to counteract them. The occasion afforded
a fresh display of the zeal and intrepidity of Vice Admiral Anson,
and Rear Admiral Warren, who with a superior force fell in with
and captured, upon the 3d day of May, five sail of the line of battle,
a large frigate, and four stout armed ships freighted on account of the
French East India Company, with troops and stores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Above Â£300,000 in money, which was intended to answer the
contingencies of these expeditions, was found on board the Men of
War, which altered its course to the Bank of England, and whither
it was escorted by a party of Marines, in military procession, amidst
the acclamations of the populace.</p>

<p>For this achievement the Vice Admiral was created a Peer of
Great Britain, and Rear Admiral Warren was invested with the Order
of the Bath.&mdash;The whole Fleet received the cordial thanks of their
Sovereign, through its Commander, in these words, and who became
the organ of the Royal wish:</p>

<p>"Sir, you have done me a great service&mdash;I thank you, and
desire you to thank, in my name, <i>all the Officers and Private Men</i>,
for their bravery and conduct, with which I am well pleased."</p>

<p>Soon after the enemy sustained a heavy commercial loss in forty-eight
sail of homeward bound West Indiamen.</p>

<p>The 14th of October, in this year, memorable for our naval
successes, was another day of triumph.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Hawke, whom the vigilance of our Ministry detached
early in August to intercept a numerous convoy then collecting
for the West Indies, continued upon his cruizing ground until that
morning, when their wished-for object was espied. After the most
gallant defence, six ships of the line struck their colours, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
carried into Portsmouth. The Order of the Bath was the well-earned
laurel of this victory to the Commander, and the legislative thanks
of a grateful country were rendered to the subordinate Officers,
Seamen, and Marines of the Squadron.</p>

<p>While victory thus crowned the British Flag, its Commerce also
continued protected by the same guardian care. A few short months
accomplished the conquest of the flower of the French Navy, the
consequences of which were soon felt in the security of our trade
and the increase of public credit. Those of the enemy were both
fast on the decline, and a general despondency prevailed throughout
their country, from which all their boasted victories upon the Continent
could not revive the nation.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this year, Rear Admiral Boscawen sailed
for the East Indies with a powerful squadron, having nearly
two thousand troops on board, in order to reinforce our ships then
inferior to the enemy upon that station, and to retrieve our affairs in
that quarter of the globe. All our exertions during this era were
employed on our proper element, in which the Marines bore a share,
and they leave not to me a single detached incident for record.</p>

<p>In the early part of this year, his Majesty directed that the several
Regiments of Marines which were then existing, or might afterwards
be raised, should for the future obey such orders as they, from time to
time, might receive from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,
from which period our present Constitution may, in some degree, be
dated.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he distresses of France had now reached their height in the
destruction of her navy, and the annihilation of her commerce. Spain
also, cut off from her resources by the vigilance of our fleets, was
equally poor, and her subjects still more wretched; while Britain,
now directed by unanimity and wisdom, seemed as if invigorated by
the struggle.</p>

<p>Great must have been the sufferings of his people, when Louis XV.
condescended to express his ardent wish for the return of peace to
an individual who was then his prisoner. That Sovereign ingenuously
avowed to Sir John Ligonier the pressures which had induced him to
urge the topic; and it was a hint too interesting for humanity to pass
unnoticed. Accordingly, a Congress was soon after held at Aix-la-Chapelle,
in order to arrange the terms of negociation. The prospect
however, did not relax our efforts, which were still greater than
ever.</p>

<p>Eleven thousand five hundred and fifty Marines were the establishment
of 1748.</p>

<p>Admiral Boscawen, who had sailed from England in November
of the last year, got sight of the Mauritius upon the 23d day of June.
His orders were to make an attack upon it, but this object was
subordinate to the conquest of Pondicherry, which was the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
view of the expedition. The enemy had long been aware of his
destination, and were well prepared to receive him. After having
reconnoitred the coast, and sounded where a probability appeared of
effecting a disembarkation, it was at last ascertained, that the powerful
means of defence which presented every where, and the dangers of
approaching the land in many places, must necessarily involve a
great sacrifice of men, and render success even ultimately doubtful.
The coming on of the autumnal monsoons had also an influence in the
decision of a Council, which was to relinquish this attempt, and to
proceed without delay for the Coast of Coromandel, the enjoined
scene of operations.</p>

<p>Upon the 27th of June, the Admiral bid adieu to the island, and
arrived at Fort St. David on the 29th of July. Here the troops were
landed and encamped, with all the necessary stores. At no period
could the Nation ever boast of a more zealous or faithful servant than
Admiral Boscawen. It was now but a short interval ere he proceeded
to carry his instructions into effect, under his own auspices;
having entrusted the Fleet to Captain Lisle, the next in command,
who had orders to co-operate to the utmost.</p>

<p>Previous to the departure of Vice Admiral Griffin, with four ships
intended for Europe, the Marines were drafted from them, and added
to the battalion, which upon this service consisted of eight hundred
and eighty rank and file. The whole amounting to four thousand
one hundred and twenty British and Country troops to be afterwards
reinforced by two thousand native auxiliaries, and one thousand one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
hundred sailors, trained to small arms, were to form the besieging
army. The battering cannon, mortars, and every implement were
conveyed by the squadron within two miles of the town, while the
land forces began their march towards Pondicherry, on the 8th of
August, about thirty miles distant. They were uninterrupted till the
11th, when a shew of opposition was made by an intrenched force
of the enemy on the banks of a river. These gave way, however,
upon the advance of a detachment to attack them. On the other
side stood the fort of Arian-Coupan, which it was essential to carry
previous to opening the siege. A force of seven hundred men,
composed of grenadiers, and the piquets of the Army were deemed
adequate to this attempt by the Engineers who reconnoitred the
works. In this service they had been unhappily deceived, from
the peculiarity of the ground in front of the fort, the real strength
of which was hid from their view.</p>

<p>Unprepared for the assault, our brave men, when too late, found
its formidable state, but with a persevering though an unfortunate
spirit, they continued an attack which afforded no hope of success.</p>

<p>The enemy now galling them extremely by flanking fires from two
batteries on the opposite side of the river, a retreat was made after
the loss of 150 men killed and wounded, and amongst them some
of our best officers. The fall of Major Goodere of the Artillery,
upon this occasion, was peculiarly lamented, and from his high
professional talents, was considered as an event inauspicious to the
future operations of the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The detachment being repulsed, retired towards the sea, in
order to preserve a communication with the ships, and thus to disembark
the cannon and stores. Here they slept all night upon their
arms, and on the following day, the 13th of August, were joined
by the army. In the afternoon the 1100 Seamen were landed under
Captain Lloyd.</p>

<p>It was now determined to carry on approaches in regular form.
Upon the 17th a battery of four guns was opened, but being
injudiciously placed it produced no effect. The Artillery Officers
having volunteered to construct another, it began on the following
morning with such success, that a desperate attempt was made by
the enemy to destroy it. This at first succeeded, but our men soon
rallying from a temporary panic, the French were beat back and their
Commanding Officer taken prisoner. Major Lawrence, however,
and some officers scorning to participate in the early terror which
seized the troops, became captives.</p>

<p>Upon the 20th some gunpowder taking fire within the Fort, the
principal Battery blew up, by which explosion upwards of 100 of the
enemy perished. They then, by putting matches to the different
mines, demolished all the fortifications, and the remains retreated to
Pondicherry.</p>

<p>The ruins were soon occupied by our troops, who were employed,
until the 25th in rendering this post tenable. They afterwards
crossed the river of Arian-Coupan, and got possession of a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
situation within a mile of the place, without a shew of contest. This
being to the north west of the town, a communication was from
thence maintained with the ships to the northward of it, and all the
implements necessary for the siege were now landed.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 1st of September the Advanced Guard
of 100 men, consisting principally of Marines, was attacked by very
superior forces, which were headed by Mons. Portalis, the principal
Engineer of the enemy; who was mortally wounded, besides four
other Officers, and the whole were repulsed with a loss of upwards of
120 soldiers.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion a woman fought in the Marine Ranks of the
name of Hannah Snell, a native of Worcester, who, after many
chequered destinies, inlisted at Portsmouth in Colonel Frazer's
regiment, from whence she was embarked with a detachment on
board the Swallow sloop, one of Admiral Boscawen's squadron. In
this affair she behaved with distinguished courage, having fired 37
rounds, and received a ball in the groin, which, two days afterwards,
she herself extracted, and likewise dressed the wound. Eleven
others in both legs, but of inferior consequence also, rendered her
removal to the Hospital, at Cuddalore, absolutely necessary, where
she continued three months.</p>

<p>When recovered she was ordered on board the Eltham frigate,
in which she continued till that ship returned home and was paid
off. After receiving her discharge from the Marine Service, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
company with many of her companions, she set out for London.
The time arrived when they were to bid each other a long adieu;
this moment she chose to discover her sex, in order to attest the
truth of her adventures. One of her friends tendered his hand,
which was declined. She afterwards wore the Marine Dress, and
having presented a petition to his Royal Highness the Duke of
Cumberland, he, with a princely spirit, attended to her prayer,
and placed her on the King's list for a pension of thirty pounds a year
for life. This she enjoyed until a few years ago, when, after a
long residence at Walsall, in Staffordshire, her days were closed.</p>

<p>It was not until the 25th of September that the batteries were
completed, when they began to play. Owing to a general ignorance
of the plan of Pondicherry, our first attack was directed against its
strongest quarter, and after different approaches, it was discovered
that a deep and intervening morass prevented their being carried within
a distance near enough to produce effect. Notwithstanding a combined
cannonade on the part of the squadron, against the town, it
was found that the enemy's fire rather gained an ascendency. Sickness
becoming prevalent, from the fatigues endured by the troops, often
up to the middle in water; the rainy season being daily expected,
which would inundate the country and cut off their retreat to Fort
St. David's, and the army rapidly diminishing in its numbers,
afforded strong grounds for immediately abandoning the siege. A
Council of War, held on the 30th of September, determined
upon this measure, after which period the only objects to be
accomplished were reimbarking the men and stores, and setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fire to the batteries, all which were effected upon the 5th of October,
and the whole were in motion upon the morning of the 6th.</p>

<p>They had happily chosen the critical moment for retreat, as the rains
which fell upon the same evening, had nearly rendered the rivers
impassible; however they reached Fort St. David's upon the evening
of the 7th, after having demolished the Fort of Arian-Coupan on
their way.</p>

<p>The want of Engineers was bitterly felt throughout the whole,
and though it was in many instances amply compensated by the
handsome and voluntary tenders of service, from the Officers of the
Corps of Royal Artillery, still these were of too subordinate a nature
to remedy the errors committed in the leading plan of operations.</p>

<p>We had also to combat a garrison nearly equal to our own army,
which was but little aided by the Native Auxiliaries, whose chief
use lay in guarding the skirts of our Camp from surprize, or harassing
parties; for they would never defend any post without being supported
by European troops.</p>

<p>This disaster involved a loss of 1065 Whites of every description,
while that of the enemy did not exceed 500.</p>

<p>In the West Indies an attack was again intended against St. Jago,
in Cuba, by some land forces embarked at Jamaica and the Marines
of the squadron, with which design the whole put to sea, but after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
long perseverance against strong northerly winds, which prevented
their approaching that coast, it was given up, and diverted to an
enterprize against Port Louis on the south side of Hispaniola. This
service was performed by the ships in line of battle, which, after three
hours heavy cannonade, compelled its Governor to surrender upon
terms, when Major Scott, with a detachment of Governor Trelawney's
regiment, and the Marines, were landed, and took possession of the
Fort in the name of his Majesty.</p>

<p>After having shipped or destroyed upwards of 80 heavy cannon,
and blown up the works, the whole were re-embarked.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the present year a very serious mutiny occurred
on board his Majesty's ship Chesterfield, upon the coast of Africa, but
like all attempts of so diabolical a nature, it was suppressed by the
spirited efforts of a few well disposed of her crew. This leads me to the
reflection, that, however brave and intrepid the character of a British
Seaman is, still his valour becomes palsied the moment it is exerted
in a wrong cause. Such indeed must ever be the consequence of such
ill aimed combinations. The wretch who is capable of subverting his
country's interests cares but little for those of his friends. In principle
a villain, he never fails being the first to desert and betray the
unfortunate men, who are the dupes of his counsels, particularly
when his own life appears in danger.</p>

<p>In order to exhibit how dangerous it is even to <i>conceal</i> the
existence of a mutiny, I will state an instance which arose out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
above occasion:&mdash;After the Chesterfield was recovered from those
daring insurgents, she was carried into Barbadoes, when all the
culprits were put on board the Richmond, excepting two. Some
of them were indulged with their liberty and to mess with that ship's
company; so liberal are our laws even to the criminal, before trial
and condemnation.</p>

<p>Having, by their protestations of innocence, interested some
of the people in their favour, T. Ferriman, the ship's Steward,
I believe from pure motives, and wishing to discover those who
had united in planning their escape, drew out a paper for the
signature of all who wished well to the scheme. Within two
hours he was himself informed against, by one who had subscribed
to it, and being found in his pocket, it was too powerful an evidence
to resist that article of War which holds him equally guilty with the
perpetrator, who <i>knowingly conceals</i> any gathering mutiny even for a
moment.</p>

<p>Every detail of active operation closes with the peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle, now a second time rendered memorable by the
growth of the Olive.</p>

<p>After more than nine years hostility, all the powers agreed to a
general restitution of conquests. France and Spain were left to lament
a ruined Navy, and an impoverished people, while Great Britain felt
an accession of more than four millions of circulating specie, which
concealed from the public view a large addition to her national debt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time the respective rank between the sea and land
Officers was decreed by his Majesty, and an order issued for an
exact uniformity of dress throughout the naval service.</p>

<p>Amongst the many reductions which now progressively took
place, during 1748, and the early part of the ensuing year, may be
remarked the total extinction of the Marine establishment, the Officers
of which, at these successive periods, were placed on half pay.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">P</span>eace having been proclaimed upon the 2d of February, 1749, the
liberal policy of Government was soon after conspicuous towards its
disbanded servants.</p>

<p>The settlement of Nova Scotia, hitherto a neglected spot, presented
itself to the enlightened mind of the Earl of Halifax as a proper field
for improvement, and it readily occurred to him, as a fit occasion, for
rendering useful to the State a body of men, that might have otherwise
been let loose upon society.</p>

<p>Accordingly grants of land in that Province, were tendered
to every rank of his Majesty's land and sea forces, and as a spur to
immediate population, an extension of privilege and property was
allowed to him, who should embark his family, in proportion to its
numbers.</p>

<p>Some of the liberal professions, and mechanicks of different
descriptions were also invited to become adventurers, under similar
inducements, and the plan of a happy Civil Government emanating
from a British fountain, was early framed for the permanent happiness
of these military colonists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Under such assurances above 4000 bid adieu to their native shore,
and upon the 21st of June the whole anchored in the bay of Chebucto,
upon the southern coast of the Province, where a town was quickly
raised, fortified, and divided into lots, which was named Halifax;
a monument of the liberal and humane views of its noble patron.
The occasion merits many a reflection which I am not allowed to
indulge.</p>

<p>While it is the wisdom, it is also the interest of every Country
to frame employ for those who have served it faithfully in war.
A distinction between the industrious and the profligate would soon
be marked by Society, and the worthless wanderer roaming about
unpitied, would be compelled to contribute to his own support, and
thus promote the general good.</p>

<p>Every circumstance after the peace tended to shew that it was
only a temporary expedient on the part of France.</p>

<p>Alternately they continued to inflame and negociate during
nearly the whole interval of public repose, and by their extensive
Naval preparations, which were not confined to their own Country,
they obviously evinced the intention of renewing hostilities when
they felt themselves in sufficient power.</p>

<p>Upwards of six years provocation and remonstrance had elapsed,
when repeated insults aroused the Nation. Early in 1755 our
armaments began, at which time a levy of 50 Companies of Marines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

<p>These, formed into three divisions, were placed at Chatham,
Portsmouth, and Plymouth, under the controul of the Board of
Admiralty, and an Act was passed for their regulation while on
shore.</p>

<p>Some of the names detailed, still live, while others, like them,
survived to hold distinguished rank, and to prove ornaments to their
profession, and the British Army.</p>

<p>From this era the Marine Corps has ever constituted a branch of
the peace establishment, the sale of Commissions was abolished,
although a transit between the Army and it, was still kept up,
which, from the casual introduction of men of influence, animated
promotion. But this system was soon changed, by which reform all
Officers rose in regular rotation, and what is the regulation of the
present day. Every appointment in the Marine Corps was notified
from the Admiralty, and appeared in the London Gazette; a practice
for reasons I know not, has been since discontinued.</p>

<p>Although no declaration of war had taken place, still hostilities
of a serious nature had been committed in America, and captures to an
immense amount were made by our cruizers during 1755. Even
since the signature of peace, indeed, the French maintained a spirit
of inveteracy in the East, which aimed at universal dominion. Preparations
were at last commenced, and the country at large began
to feel their wrongs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIX" id="CHAP_XIX"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">A</span>n unaccountable dread pervaded the nation, which the public
measures certainly tended to heighten. In the early part of 1756
the enemy had collected immense forces upon their coasts with the
avowed object of invading England. Foreign auxiliaries were
called in, measures of precaution and defence were adopted, while
the real objects of attack from all their mighty threats, were
entirely forgotten and neglected. Amongst the additional forces
voted during the present year, 9138 Marines were decreed by
Parliament; in order to complete which 30 additional companies
were ordered to be raised. The expedient of a land impress was
resorted to, in the form of an "Act for the more speedy and effectual
recruiting his Majesty's Land Forces and Marines," but which was
suspended by a Royal Order upon the 1st of May, in consequence of
the zealous and patriotic co-operations of the nobility and gentry, who,
by their purses and their energies, rendered it unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The real designs of the French having been developed in an
expedition against Minorca, while they continued to amuse the
nation by the terrors of an invasion, produced a declaration of
war upon the 18th of May, against that power. Admiral Byng
had been detached for its relief, and had previously been ordered
to disembark all the Marines from his ships, in order to take
on board a number of land forces destined for the relief of that
garrison.</p>

<p>Commodore Edgcumbe, who commanded the British squadron in
the Mediterranean, foreseeing an attack upon the island, had landed
1 Captain, 2 Subalterns, 4 Serjeants, 4 Corporals, 3 Drummers, and
104 Rank and File, being nearly the whole of his Marines, to
strengthen its defence, who shared in the fatigues and the glory of
that distinguished siege under Lieutenant General Blakeney. Much
spirit and determined bravery was evinced in the course of it.</p>

<p>After more than two months tedious approaches, the enemy
stormed, upon the 25th of June, in different points, but with partial
success. The firing had continued from ten at night until four upon
the following morning, when Marshall Richelieu beat a parley in
order to bury his dead. But he shamefully invaded the interval
of suspension, by reinforcing the lodgments he had gained, which
communicating by subterraneous passages, afforded easy access into the
body of the place itself.</p>

<p>This led to its immediate fall, by capitulation, after seventy
days contest, and is an instance of what little confidence
should be placed in the French character, under every similar
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nation, always too apt to despond from slight causes, most
bitterly lamented this event, which was preceded by the very
unwelcome tidings of a drawn battle between the hostile fleets.
Sir Edward Hawke succeeded the unfortunate Admiral, who became
a victim to the strict letter of the law, and the general prejudices of
his Country. From a vast superiority our commerce in those seas
was well protected, while that of the enemy suffered extremely.
The constant threats of descent appeared to paralyse every exertion
but that of domestic security; while the enemy were carrying on
their schemes of distant conquest under the panic which these had
produced.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year a new Ministry was formed,
to which the Nation looked with confidence and hope.</p>

<p>In this administration that great and manly character, Mr. Pitt,
was one.&mdash;No farther details occur under the era of 1756.&mdash;The
Marines, in common with their brethren in the British Fleet,
shared in the credit which was gained by some partial actions
during the year.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">A</span>n addition of twenty companies was ordered early in the year
1757, to complete the parliamentary vote of eleven thousand four
hundred and nineteen marines.</p>

<p>The happy change which had taken place in the councils of the
nation seemed to extend its effects through every department.&mdash;That
vigor and unanimity was, however, again suspended by intrigue and
faction, of which the enemy availed themselves, by detaching with
impunity, reinforcements to their distant dominions.</p>

<p>A coalition of parties having been accomplished, re-animated the
country, but nothing peculiarly interesting or falling within my scope,
can be remarked within the current incidents of this year. Some
partial naval actions, which did honor to the leaders, and which
reflected credit upon all the subordinates who had a share, were
fought within this period. They evinced that our spirit was not
extinguished, but that it only awaited the auspices of some guiding
hand, and a higher occasion, to render it of substantial benefit to the
public.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXI" id="CHAP_XXI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he fears of an invasion began now to subside, and these warlike
preparations which had hitherto been made with a view to self
defence, were, under the bold and enterprizing genius of Mr. Pitt,
soon to be turned against the enemy's coasts. This was necessary
to animate the people, as well as politic in forcing the French to
withdraw a part of their immense forces upon the Continent. A
farther augmentation of thirty Companies was granted to the Corps
of Marines, to keep pace with the general energies, which
completed their establishment to fourteen thousand eight hundred and
forty-five, being the vote for the service of 1758. At this period
too, that highly useful body of men, the National Militia, was
ordered to be raised and organized for domestic security, while
our regular armies were employed in retaliating the terrors of
invasion, and in carrying the war into the foreign possessions of our
enemies.</p>

<p>Early in this year was fought the memorable action between the
Monmouth and Foudroyant, which must ever be considered as one
of the most distinguished events upon our Naval Annals. Monsieur
De Quesne, with a nobleness that did him the highest honour, in
delivering his sword to Lieutenant Carkett, the representative of the
gallant Captain Gardiner who fell, was not ashamed to avow that
he had surrendered only to the force of the Monmouth. The great
inequality in this contest confers a lasting credit upon the meanest
individual who bore a part in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Edward Hawke, commanding a squadron of seven sail of the
line, observing a number of the enemy's ships, with forty transports
full of troops, at anchor off the Isle of Aix, he pushed on with a
view to attack them; but they slipped their cables, and were run
ashore upon the mud, after having thrown their guns and stores
over board, by which means they escaped. The enemy had been
employed in repairing the works upon the island that were
destroyed in our expedition of last year. The Admiral disembarked
Captain Ewer, with a party of one hundred and forty Marines, upon
the 5th of April, with orders to demolish them. This service was
effected with discipline and humanity, as it was accomplished
most completely, and without the smallest molestation to the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>An expedition having been meditated to the Coast of Africa,
consisting of two hundred Marines, under Major Mason, and a
detachment of Artillery, it sailed from Plymouth on the 9th of
March. Upon the 24th of April, this squadron, under the command
of Captain Marsh, arrived off the river Senegal, and against the 29th,
the small craft got over the shallow bar, being opposed by some
vessels of force, which were, however, obliged to retire, when a
landing was made. Early on the following day, being about to
advance against Fort Lewis, situated upon a small island about
twelve miles farther up the river, a deputation from the Superior
Council of Senegal arrived, with articles of capitulation, which were
accepted. In consequence, Major Mason, with his Marines, took
possession of the Fort upon the 2d of May, in which was a garrison
of two hundred and forty soldiers and ninety pieces of cannon, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
treasure and merchandize to a great amount. During this short
service, the sufferings of the men were great, as many of the boats
having the tents, cannon, and ammunition, were overset upon the
bar, which circumstance exposed them to the nightly dews and the
scorching sun upon that inclement coast, without a shelter. Being
a key to their grand Establishment at Goree, this acquisition was
of much importance.</p>

<p>It falls a second time to my lot to mention the active services of
my Corps in the conquest of Cape Breton, and its Capital, now rendered
more formidable by experience. A violent surf prevented the
landing of our forces, under the conduct of Sir Jeffrey Amherst, seconded
by the Brigadier Generals Whitmore, Laurence, and Wolfe, from the
2d until the 8th of June, during which the ships were exposed to
a cannonade from cannon and mortars. Upon that day, the
debarkation took place in different points, amidst the greatest
difficulties, during which Gen. Wolfe was very highly distinguished.
Some lives, and about one hundred boats were lost in the attempt.
After different preparations and approaches, which would be too
wide a field for my detail, the Marines of the Fleet were landed,
on the 26th of June, when being formed into a battalion, they
took post at Kennington-cove, and afforded a vast relief to the Army
then occupied in very extensive duties. Upon the 30th, they were
engaged at this post, and repulsed the enemy. Their ships in the
harbour continuing to incommode our troops, an enterprize was
formed against them during the night of the 25th of July, which
occasion very much signalized Captains Laforey and Macbride of
the Royal Navy, who took and destroyed the Beinfaisant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Prudent. Upon the 26th, the French proposed terms, by which five
thousand six hundred and thirty-seven soldiers and sailors became
prisoners of war, and in the capitulation was included the surrender of
the islands of Cape Breton and St. John's. Gen. Amherst, in public
orders, desired the Commanders of every Corps to acquaint the Officers
and Men with the high satisfaction which he felt from the bravery
and good conduct of the troops&mdash;a conduct that had, and always
must insure success, and what he would take the liberty of reporting
to his Sovereign. A severe blow to the navy of France, was one of
the happy circumstances of this achievement.</p>

<p>Considering the many detached enterprizes with which the year
1758 was marked, the most sanguine could not hope that all would
succeed without loss, where the chief objects were to land upon, to
harass, and keep in alarm the widely extended coasts of France.</p>

<p>Although the affair at St. Cas, in the month of September, was
unfortunate in its issue, still no incident occurred that tarnished
the honour of our arms. More impetuous courage was never shewn,
than by the handful of men which formed the rear guard of the British
Army upon that service, who had to combat very superior
numbers. Previous to this, an opportunity offered to signalize the
parties of Marines belonging to three ships of Commodore Howe's
Squadron, in an attack upon the Castle of Latte, situated on a
peninsula in the entrance to St. Maloes' harbour. A joint attempt
had been concerted between a Naval force and a detachment from
the Army upon the heights above Arborough Bay, upon the 4th of
September, but the ships could not stand near enough to produce
effect without an imminent risk; when after a short contest, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
relinquished, by the co-operating troops. These parties of Marines
having been landed upon the night of the 9th, attacked and carried
it without loss. In consequence of the success which had attended
the expedition against the coast of Africa, another was formed against
Goree, which sailed from Cork upon the 11th of November, under the
joint conduct of Commodore Keppel and Lieutenant Colonel Worge, the
newly-appointed Governor of Senegal. A body of land forces, and
the Marines of the squadron were the forces intended to carry this
service into effect. After a very dangerous passage, the whole
gained sight of Goree, upon the 28th of December, excepting the
Lichfield of fifty guns, and a transport, that were wrecked upon the
inhospitable shore of Barbary. About two o'clock the squadron
reached abreast of the island, then four miles distant, while
the transports were ordered to a bay between Point Goree and Point
Barabbas, to be in readiness to land the troops on a signal being
made. Every disposition being arranged for an immediate attack,
early in the morning of the 29th, the troops were embarked in the
flat-bottomed boats, in order to push ashore upon the island when
adviseable, while a general cannonade was opened by the ships
against the different points of defence. After a most tremendous
firing of some hours continuance, the enemy struck their colours,
in order to establish a parley, that ended in an almost immediate
renewal of hostilities, which soon obliged Monsieur de St. Jean to
surrender at discretion. Commodore Keppel instantly landed all the
Marines, who took possession and occupied the fort until every
arrangement was made. The loss upon this service was extremely
trifling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Many were the occasions that distinguished the Naval and Military
Forces of his Majesty during the present active year, which, from their
number, cannot fall within my detail. Both Corps seemed animated
with a spirit of unsurpassed zeal and enterprize, which the Marine
of France, her Commerce, and her coasts most bitterly felt. This
era exhibited many early specimens of the courage and talents of
some individuals, whose merits and great abilities very justly placed
them in high commands during the subsequent stages of their lives,
and whose names can never be mentioned but with encomium.</p>

<p>The amphibious duties of the Marine Soldier necessarily placed
him in many of these active scenes, and from that close connection
in which he now stood towards the Naval Establishment of his
country, he may be said to have always been a sharer in the honours
that arose from the brilliant single actions at sea, with which the
year abounded.</p>

<p>A bill framed in wisdom, policy, and humanity, originated and
passed in 1758, under the able and enlightened auspices of the
Honourable Mr. George Grenville. This was for the encouragement
of Seamen in the Royal Navy, by which these well-meaning, but
unthinking men, were enabled to cast an eye of compassion and
relief towards their suffering families. By this institution they might
allot such a part of their pay as they did not choose to receive, to
their wives, parents, or others, to which amount they had tickets
from the Commissioners, which on being remitted to any part of
the country, were payable on demand by the Collectors of
Customs and Excise within Great Britain. Its liberal tendency
is too obvious for remark; and it is only singular, that from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
acknowledged influence, such was not earlier extended to the
Marine Soldier, who constantly participated in the dangers, the glory,
and the duties of our Fleets.&mdash;The man who has resolution and virtue
to forfeit his own comforts, and to alienate a great part of them
towards the subsistence of his distant relatives, affords the strongest test
of his genuine character. He who is true to domestic ties, will
never, by insubordination, dissolve those that unite him to his country.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">F</span>ourteen thousand eight hundred and forty-five Marines formed
the Establishment of 1759.</p>

<p>The manly, daring, and enlightened mind of him who guided
the public measures, was never more conspicuous than in the extensive
plans which directed the operations of the present year. Superior to the
menaces of invasion, though still not despising them, he did not
limit the national energies to a system of self-defence, but resolved
upon carrying war and conquest against the distant territories of our
enemy. The spirit of Englishmen, thus roused, kept pace with the
bold views of Mr. Pitt, and while it has convinced the world how
invincible we are when knit together in the bonds of union, let us
imitate the examples of this happy period, upon every return of
public danger!</p>

<p>One of the most gallant single actions with which this contest
was marked, occurred in the West Indies, towards the close of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
1758. It is narrated by Captain Tyrrell, of the Buckingham, who
fought it, in all the honest simplicity of a British Seaman, and bears
high testimony to the gallant conduct of those under his command.
This gratifying tribute, when merited, should never be withheld
from the meanest, and it must ever honourably characterize the man
who bestows it. Falling in with the Florissant, of 74 guns, and
two heavy frigates, in his Majesty's Ship Buckingham, of 70, he
bravely engaged them and obliged the first to strike; but night
coming on, she availed herself of its darkness, made sail, and
escaped from her disabled antagonist. Speaking of my Corps, Capt.
Tyrrell's words are, "Capt. Troy, at the head of his Marines,
performed the service of a brave and gallant Officer, cleared the
poop and quarter-deck of the enemy, and drove her men like
sheep down the main deck."</p>

<p>The defenceless state of the French Carribee Islands, induced
an expedition against them, which sailed from Europe towards the
end of November, 1758, under General Hopson and Commodore
Hughes, and arrived at Barbadoes upon the 3d of January following.
This Squadron, consisting of seven sail of the line, one of fifty guns,
besides frigates, had on board nearly eight hundred Marines, headed by
Brevet Col. Rycaut, of the Portsmouth Division, which were intended
to form a battalion, to co-operate with the army; but Commodore
Moore assuming the command of our Naval Forces in these seas, after
this junction, cancelled that plan, and adopted the idea of landing
each party in detachment, when necessary. By this measure the
public character of Colonel Rycaut was suspended, and that regular
system of discipline, which must ever result from the union of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
under one form, was sacrificed. This leads me to notice, that the
Marine Soldier is peculiarly exposed to a great disadvantage upon every
service of combined operation. Constantly employed in small detachments,
it is frequently his lot, at a short notice, to enter the field
against the well-trained legions of his enemies, and to unite his
energies with the Regular and Brigaded Forces of his country. He,
in this new scene, perhaps, knows not his file leader, and is
probably a stranger to his officer.</p>

<p>As the predominant duties of this class of men are on board our
navy, where military evolutions can only be performed upon a narrow
scale; considering that a sudden and unforeseen emergency may place
them in the situation I have described, it might be a means of rousing
an emulous zeal between each, and of fixing that intimacy which
is requisite to promote a mutual confidence, to form the detachments
in every Fleet, or Squadron, into one battalion, or more; which being
constantly maintained in a state of arrangement, would be better
prepared for these momentary calls. The benefit which must arise
would far counterbalance any trifling expence that might be incurred
in the different necessary appendages to such establishments, and
would afford opportunities by which to recompence the meritorious
individuals of a Corps, whose hopes cannot now aspire above one
uniform level.</p>

<p>The whole of this armament sailed against Martinico on the 13th
day of January; the land forces, having been already reduced by
the fever and small pox.</p>

<p>During the night of the 15th the squadron beat up into the Bay
of Port Royal, and on the following morning his Majesty's ship Bristol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
attacked and silenced Fort Negro, a strong battery of seven guns.
Her Marines, as well as those of the Rippon, were immediately
landed, who, with fixed bayonets, climbed up the rocks and entered
the embrazures, without resistance, as the enemy had abandoned the
works. The British colours were hoisted at ten, and the army was
afterwards disembarked in the neighbourhood of that post, where
they slept on their arms.</p>

<p>Next day a Council of War determined to change the attack
against St. Pierre's, when the troops returned on board, and the
guns were destroyed. After some consideration this idea was also
relinquished, and it was resolved to proceed against Guadaloupe.
Having made that island upon the morning of the 23d, a disposition
of attack, against Basseterre and the Forts, was given out, which
commenced at nine, and continued, without an interval, until night,
when the whole were silenced.</p>

<p>The loss was confined in this long and heavy cannonade, to
Lieutenant Roberts, of Marines, in the Norfolk, killed; Captain
Trelawney, of the Lyon, Lieutenants Curle and Chaudy, of Marines,
on board that ship and the Rippon, wounded; with 30 of different
descriptions killed and 60 wounded. The town was unhappily
set on fire, which irritated the flying inhabitants to a more vigorous
defence of the island.</p>

<p>Upon the 24th the troops were landed, when the French
abandoned the works they had began on the rising ground behind
Basseterre, without opposition. Our army took possession of them
and halted there during the night. Next morning the enemy also
deserted the citadel, retiring towards the mountains with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
resolution of resting their future defence upon the chance of sickness
gaining ground amongst our troops, and of succours from Europe.
The 61st regiment, under Major Teesdale, was directed to occupy
the town and citadel. This detachment owed their salvation to a
Genoese deserter, who informed the Commanding Officer, when on
the eve of entering the latter, of their impending danger from the
explosion of a mine to which the train had been laid, and that was
to have been fired by a Negro, who, unaware of the hazard to
himself, was bribed to this duty. By pushing rapidly into the citadel,
the train was found, and timely swept away, as the dark coloured
emissary was advancing, with drunken and staggering steps, to have
executed the diabolical design.</p>

<p>Upon the 25th the field pieces, and every necessary implement
were landed, and the ground marked out for the different regiments,
in such a manner as to co-operate instantly when required. A corps
of Light Infantry, drawn from the several Battalions, was also formed
and placed under the command of Major (now General) Melville,
which rendered very essential services.</p>

<p>The French Commandant, Mons. Nadau, took post in a deep
cleft of the mountains, which commanded his supplies from Cape
Terres, by far the best cultivated quarter of the island. Every
approach to this recess was also guarded by intrenchments. Upon
the 26th a summons was sent him, which he modestly but firmly
rejected.</p>

<p>Some trifling skirmishes, that involved nothing except a loss of
men took place, instead of that active system of enterprize, which
should, if possible, be ever followed in a West India warfare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
The enemy gathered spirit from our inactivity, and in their turn
harassed and insulted the Citadel itself, and the relief of our Guards.
This error, however, afforded an opportunity of distinguishing
the 61st Regiment, which was successfully employed in dislodging
the enemy from the grounds they occupied.</p>

<p>An attack being meditated against Fort Louis, upon the Grande
Terre, or North East side of the Island, a Squadron was ordered,
under Captain Harman, of the Berwick, with some Companies of
the Highland Regiment, under Major Campbell, of the Marines;
he having also a considerable detachment of his own Corps. The
whole proceeded to execute this service upon the 6th of February, from
which day, till the 13th, the ketches continued a brisk bombardment.
The Squadron advanced to the contest early on that morning,
and after five hours cannonade, silenced the Fort and its numerous
dependant batteries. During this attack, the Highlanders and Marines
were in the flat-bottomed boats, ready to seize upon the first favourable
moment for debarkation; and on this signal being made they
bravely pushed ashore, under a heavy resumed fire from every point
of the enemy's defence. Major Campbell, upon this occasion,
allowed them no breathing time; for finding that the ammunition
was generally injured by landing at an improper place, he resolutely
pushed on with fixed bayonets, and after a severe action carried the
Fort, with, all the batteries. This was not accomplished without
a considerable loss.</p>

<p>An unhappy plan of procrastinated operation continued
to mark our progress in the neighbourhood of Basseterre, which
assumed, however, a more active form under Gen. Barrington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
who succeeded to the command of the Army, after the death of
General Hopson, on the 27th of February.&mdash;Resolving to change
the plan of operation, he withdrew his forces from Basseterre,
leaving a garrison in Fort Royal, and blowing up the other
works.</p>

<p>The whole now directed their course to Fort Louis on the 7th of
March, where the transports did not arrive until the 20th, owing to
the prevalence of strong lee currents. Intelligence being received
of a powerful French Squadron having reached Martinique, induced
the Commodore to leave the Army at this critical period to their own
energies, and to proceed whither he might be enabled to counteract
its future schemes. Accordingly the Marines were withdrawn from
the shore, and distributed amongst their proper ships; but such was
their reduced state in consequence of this service, that detachments
were also necessarily solicited from the General to supply the heavy
casualties which had occurred to them.</p>

<p>After a tedious, fatiguing, and spirited train of operation, upon
which I am now precluded from remark, General Barrington
effected the conquest of Guadaloupe on the 2d of May, and with
it the neighbouring islands of Marigalante, Deseada, and The Saintes.
Every one conversant in the military obstacles which present in that
inhospitable country, cannot restrain his applause of the distinguished
perseverance of the Commander in Chief, and the
gallant Subordinates during the whole course of their arduous duties.
It exhibits a powerful example of what may be achieved by the
talents and active spirit of one man; but they are inherent in that
noble family, whose virtues I cannot enhance by any panegyric of mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever we cast an eye the most glorious achievements appear
before us. The conquest of Canada and its Capital, was a most
conspicuous event, but it was dearly purchased with the life of one
man whose exalted genius and patriotic soul were fitted to turn the
scale of Empires. The Plains of Abraham will be a lasting memorial
of the superior steadiness and valour of British Soldiers, when led by
courage and ability. The fatigues and services of the navy
throughout the whole of this campaign were severe and highly
honorable.</p>

<p>This leads me to notice a very ludicrous circumstance that
occurred on the morning of the 13th of September, previous to that
battle which decided the fate of Quebec.&mdash;A number of Tars who
had been employed in dragging the cannon to the heights upon
which they were planted, when returning to their ships, observed
the army drawn up in battle array, instead of continuing their route,
they fell into the ranks with the Soldiers, some having cutlasses,
others sticks, and a few having nothing in their hands. General
Wolfe remarking their zeal, addressed them with that complacency
which was so familiar to him, thanked them for their well meant
spirit, urged them to go on board, and pointed out the probable bad
consequences from their mingling with the soldiery at so critical a
moment. To this request some of them answered, "God bless your
Honour, pray let us stay and see fair play between the English and
French." The General could not help smiling at these brave but
thoughtless fellows, and again repeated his wish for them to withdraw.
With this some complied, but others swore, immediately on
turning his back, "that the Soldiers should not have all the fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to themselves, but that they would come in for a share of it some
way or other."</p>

<p>It appears that a number actually continued in the ranks during
the progress of the day, and whenever a Soldier dropped they
alternately put on his accoutrements, charged, and fired with perfect
coolness.</p>

<p>Nothing peculiarly active fell to the lot of the Marines, excepting
an affair of diversion on the 12th of September, with a view to aid
the more material operations of the army.</p>

<p>Upon the evening of that day the Admiral ordered the flat
bottomed boats, below the town, to assemble astern of one of the
frigates. Into these all the Marines which could consistently be
spared, were embarked, and at the break of day of the 13th stood
over towards the Beaufort shore as if to make a descent, while
the ships of war that escorted them were ordered to cannonade
the French lines. This feint obliged the enemy to retain a
greater force at those works, than they would otherwise have
done, and it was in some degree instrumental towards the success of
that glorious day.</p>

<p>In the summer of the present year orders were given for each
ship of the line, upon the home station, to take on board a double
complement of Marines, to co-operate in the descents which might
be attempted by the army.</p>

<p>Discomfited in every quarter, the enemy now confined their
designs to domestic preparations, which aimed at a general but
connected invasion of this island. Of these our Cabinet was fully
apprized, and well knew how to frustrate them. Admiral De La Clue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with a considerable force, having put to sea from Toulon, in order to
effect a junction with their grand armament at Brest, was soon after
observed by Admiral Boscawen, and defeated with a loss of five of
his ships, while the remains took shelter in the port of Cadiz, where
they were blocked up by an English squadron. This reverse was
little expected by the French Ministry, who could not conceive that
our energies were every where.</p>

<p>The enemy defended themselves with bravery, and they had
set them, by their Chief, a most heroic example. Such as might
have been expected was given by Admiral Boscawen to his
fleet.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Rodney destroyed a link of that chain of preparation
by the bombardment of Havre de Grace, where a large collection of
boats had been formed, denominated Prames. These were flat
bottomed, were about 100 feet long, 24 broad, and 10 in depth,
each mounted two heavy cannon, had one mast, could sail or row
when most convenient, and was capable of transporting 280 troops,
or nearly 50 cavalry complete. Our good friends, the Dutch, ever
ready to supply all parties, suffered a heavy loss during the blockade
of Havre, in naval and military stores, with which their avarice had
prompted them to supply our purposed invaders.</p>

<p>The honour of our arms was this year most gallantly supported by
Vice Admiral Pocock, in the East Indies, who was opposed to very
superior forces, but still afforded that general protection to our territory
and our commerce, which must ever constitute the most predominant
objects of our naval efforts. A sharp action was fought, which, as
might have been anticipated, ended in a drawn conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment of public danger, the protection of our coasts was
confided to Sir Edward Hawke, who shewed himself worthy of the
trust. Taking his station off Brest he detached to every quarter
within his limits, to reconnoitre and to destroy. Captain Harvey
very highly distinguished himself by a train of activity upon his post,
which was close to the mouth of that harbour. Some boats, seconded
by his flying squadron, achieved the capture of several neutral vessels
laden with naval stores, in the Bay of Camaret, which Mons.
Conflans determined to resent. He accordingly employed a very
superior force to gratify his spleen, which, however, did not stagger
Captain Harvey's resolution, who, on the contrary, advanced to
meet them. In turn he became the pursuer, which ended with the
exchange of some distant shot, and the French ships taking shelter
under their batteries.</p>

<p>The consequences that were averted by this seemingly unimportant
affair, were great, as the enemy had in view, after driving
this squadron from its ground, to have proceeded to the Morbihan,
another part of the coast of Britanny, where we had a small
blockading force stationed; after destroying which, they were to
return to Brest with the numerous land forces that were then ready
for embarkation. With such material objects before them, it is a
stigma upon their naval spirit, in not having persevered.</p>

<p>The repeated enterprizes of this vigilant Officer derive a peculiar
merit from the <i>time</i> and <i>manner</i> in which they were performed.
When the enemy were every where proclaiming their threats, Capt.
Harvey landed his Marines from the Monmouth, upon the little
island of Molines, and exacted from its inhabitants a small supply
of cattle, stock, and vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The priest upon this spot stepped forth, as the organ of his flock,
who, he said, were poor. Captain Harvey's reply was, "that he
regretted to distress the wretched; but what he now did was
merely to shew the enemy and all Europe, that the French could
not protect their people within their own sight, much less dare
the invasion of England!" He afterwards, in his own barge,
being seconded by some other boats, brought off the tender of
Admiral Conflans, from a small bay close to the harbour of Brest,
within sight of their fleet, under a prodigious cannonade of guns
and mortars, and an extensive line of musquetry. This brave man
felt for the dignity of his country, and he maintained it.</p>

<p>The enemy, every where ready to catch a favourable moment,
only awaited the time when our blockading Fleets should be driven
from their coasts, in order to carry their long-boasted threats into
effect. A heavy gale upon the 9th of November not only forced
Sir Edward Hawke from his station, but brought into Brest Monsieur
Bompart and his Squadron from the West Indies in safety. This
circumstance very much strengthened the ships of Conflans with
prime seamen, who sailed on the 14th, and steered for Quiberon Bay,
with a view to annihilate Commodore Duff's detachment, to bring
out his transports with troops, and finally to attempt the invasion of
our isles.</p>

<p>But Sir Edward Hawke anticipating his schemes, also put
to sea; and notwithstanding that contending elements, for a while,
opposed his wishes, still, by perseverance, he arrived in time to save
our Flying Squadron, just on the eve of being captured, and to give
a death blow to all their mighty hopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The victory of the 20th of November must ever stand as one
of the most brilliant upon our naval annals, not so much from the
extent of its success in captured ships, as the dangerous circumstances
under which it was achieved, and the happy consequences that were
its immediate results. Our loss upon this signal occasion was only
fifty killed, and two hundred and forty-eight Seaman and Marines
wounded.</p>

<p>Thus foiled in every quarter, their commerce cut off by the
conquest of their most valuable colonies, expensive preparations
sacrificed, without the attainment of a single object, a partial bankruptcy
took place in the national funds of France. At this trying
period, however, the sufferings of its monarch, and of the public,
were alleviated by the substantial tenders of loyalty and patriotism.
Numerous were the individuals who manfully stepped forth to heal
the wounded pride of their Sovereign, and to revive the drooping
cause of their country. It is grateful to record such instances of
public virtue from whatever source they flow.</p>

<p>In the greater part of these events, so productive of glory and
good, the Corps of Marines bore a share, as well as in the many
inferior but distinguished Naval contests that took place in 1759.
During its progress, the Fleet of our enemy acknowledges a
diminution of thirty-five Ships of the Line and an equal number of
Frigates. There are many names which still survive, and others that
have not long since closed useful and honourable lives, who were at
this period familiar to the public ear, by their gallant deeds. To
particularize all, would carry me beyond my limits, and I would not
be partial to survivors alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>His Majesty, in consideration of the very signal services rendered
by Admirals Boscawen and Sir Charles Saunders, towards the close of
this year, instituted a new Establishment of Marine Officers, intituled,
"General and Lieutenant-General of Marines," to which soon after
there were added three Colonels, nominated from Post-Captains in
the Royal Navy, who had been conspicuous by their good conduct.</p>

<p>The Gentlemen who first occupied these appointments were,</p>

<p>This establishment has subsequently been enlarged by the
attachment of a Major-General, and in this form it now exists.</p>

<p>Disclaiming every prejudice, I am led to ask how far either policy
or justice can sanction the transmission of such an institution to posterity?
They were originally the benevolent grants of a grateful Monarch, to
distinguished individuals. As such, indeed, they have continued to
be; but experience has shewn, that Field Officers are the very life
of discipline, and that if so respectable an addition were unalienated
from the <i>active members</i> of the Corps, this principle would be still
more animated.&mdash;<i>A man</i> who suppresses his feelings upon any occasion
that demands them, is unworthy of the name.&mdash;How degrading
is the thought, that the Marine Veteran, who ascends by the rules
of slow gradation, can never reach the summit of his profession!
God forbid that any reform should affect the living. Those
who now enjoy this mark of favor are highly worthy of it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
confining such appointments <i>to the corps</i> would be gratifying to all, for
I am sure that the Naval and Marine Officer are so united in their
interests and their duties, that an accession of consequence, or benefit
to either, would be warmly felt by both.</p>

defeat, but fell gloriously; leaving behind him a name equally
revered for humanity as valour.</p>

<p>The enfeebled state of France, unable to extend support to the
distant members of her Empire, exposed them as easy and alternate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
conquests to our successful arms. Although but few naval achievements
occur through this year, still the spirit of our seamen continued
the same, in every instance that presented for their efforts.</p>

<p>This era first brought into public and deserved notice, the great
military talents of Colonel, afterwards General Sir Eyre Coote.
To him may be chiefly attributed the recovery of our drooping interests
in the East, at one time nearly annihilated by the bold and
vindictive genius of Monsieur Lally.</p>

<p>Soon after the decisive battle obtained by Colonel Coote over
that General at Wandewash, Admiral Cornish reached Madras with
a reinforcement of six ships of the line. The French squadron not
appearing on the coast, enabled our joint forces to prosecute future
schemes of conquest. The first step was the advance of Colonel
Coote against Waldour, and the united blockade of Pondicherry by
sea and land. Major Monson, the second in command, was destined
to attack Carical, and accordingly embarked on board the squadron
with that view. The forces which he was to head consisted of 300
Marines, to be afterwards joined by a small body of Artillery,
some Europeans, and a considerable number of Seapoys from
Trichinopoly.</p>

<p>Admiral Cornish having arrived in the road of Carical upon the
28th of March, Major Monson was landed with the Marines and
some native pioneers, at five in the evening, where they halted
during the night, and advanced against the town early on the following
morning, which they gained with a trifling loss. Being
annoyed by Fort Dauphin, the enemy were also driven from it into
Fort Louis, by a few shells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the 3d of April all the expected reinforcements arrived,
by which the latter was immediately invested.</p>

<p>Learning on the 5th that the garrison had a prospect of relief,
and having already done considerable damage to the enemy's works,
the Commandant was summoned to surrender, to which he agreed;
the whole being considered as prisoners of war. The Seamen were
meritoriously active in landing the necessary stores during the
night-time.</p>

<p>By the successive operations of this force, the French were deprived
of many important possessions, and Monsieur Lally, with an
army, which a little while ago were the dread of that quarter, became
shut up in Pondicherry, at the commencement of May.</p>

<p>These material services having been effected, the Marines were
reimbarked on board their respective ships, and honoured by the
thanks of him who had led them. In the mean time, Colonel
Coote had carried his object, and had advanced within four miles of
Pondicherry, towards which he threw up redoubts.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Stevens having assumed the command of the
British Fleet, proceeded off that place, and at the instance of the
Governor and Council of Madras, as well as of Colonel Coote,
landed the Marines at Cuddalore, upon the 29th of August, in order
to accelerate matters before the setting in of the rains. They immediately
joined the Army, and were materially assisting in the
many active and tedious services that ensued.</p>

<p>Major Monson having received a superior commission to that of
Colonel Coote, this respectable Officer, for a while, relinquished
these bustling scenes; but the former being wounded most severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in a successful enterprize, which he conducted with great gallantry
against the enemy's batteries, was in turn compelled to resign the
command of the Army. Recent experience had convinced the public
of the value of him who had been superseded, and the highest
testimony that could have been yielded to an Officer, was recalling
him to fill the important situation he had held.</p>

<p>The high-spirited Lally, jealous only of his own honor, but
unfeeling towards the unsurpassed sufferings of those beneath him,
persevered in defending Pondicherry, while a glimpse of hope
remained. A dreadful disaster to our Fleet had nearly realized his
deliverance; but the steady seamanship of our Officers, amidst one
of the greatest hurricanes that ever blew, preserved a valuable
remains for the service of their Country, which soon resumed the
blockade of that important Capital.</p>

<p>It was not until the middle of January of the ensuing year that
it fell, and with its conquest became involved the ruin of the French
East India Company, with all their dependencies on the coast of
Coromandel.</p>

<p>Such were the happy commercial results, as well as territorial
acquisitions, that were obtained by our successful arms; in accomplishing
which the Corps of Marines was in some degree instrumental.</p>

<p>On a retrospective view, a great share of credit is justly due to
Vice-Admiral Pocock, who, with very inferior numbers, was in
three battles opposed to Monsieur D'Ache; in every one of which he
supported the honor of the British Flag, while he afforded both a
countenance and co-operation to the enterprizes of our Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of completely conquering the province of Canada was
this year carried into effect; it was well arranged, was executed
with spirit, and exhibited high military talents in Sir Jeffery Amherst,
who commanded in Chief.</p>

<p>Some of our Naval Officers contributed much to the general
success, from their intimate knowledge of the local navigation, and
their active zeal in conducting the necessary and numberless duties
of landing and re-embarking the troops.</p>

<p>The reduced state of the French Marine did not allow of many
opportunities to signalize our Fleet during this year; but whenever
they occurred, our superiority was uniformly conspicuous. From the
protection which it gave to an important branch of our commerce,
the gallant action between the Flamborough and Biddeford, both
20 gun ships, with two heavy French frigates, deserves notice.&mdash;These
had been detached on purpose to intercept our outward-bound
for Oporto and Lisbon, which they learnt was under convoy of a
small sloop of war. Fortunately for this valuable Fleet, our ships
got sight of La Malicieuse and L'Opale, of 36 guns each, upon the
morning of the 4th of April, and gave them chace. It was not until
seven in the evening, when observing our vast inferiority, the
enemy seemed willing for the combat. At this hour they closed,
and continued engaging till nine, when a short respite enabled both
to renew the battle, which continued till midnight.</p>

<p>That intrepid perseverance which so strongly marks the British
character, and in a comparative sense so peculiarly distinguishes the
British Seaman, at last prevailed, and compelled this very superior
enemy to seek safety in flight; while the disabled state of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
little ships, from the heavy metal to which they had been exposed,
precluded the idea of pursuit.</p>

<p>Captain Skinner and the Hon. Lieutenant Knollis, of the Biddeford,
fell upon this occasion; but their loss was nobly compensated
by the unremitting good example of Mr. Stacey, the Master, who
succeeded to the command.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Price, of the Marines, was also killed on board the
Flamborough.</p>

<p>The events of this action were of much greater moment than
such as frequently arise from the vindictive conflicts of greater numbers,
as it preserved a large convoy from falling into the hands of
the enemy, which would have otherwise been its fate, upon the
very day it was fought.</p>

<p>Admiral Rodney was very active with his flying squadron, while
our Grand Fleet, by its vigilance and occasional descents, entirely
cut up the enemy's commerce, and kept their sea-coasts in a state of
constant alarm, under the successive commands of Admirals Boscawen
and Hawke.</p>

<p>The nation had to deplore the loss of its Sovereign on the
morning of the 25th of October, who died alike beloved and
regretted by every class of his subjects.</p>

<p>Upon the noon of the following day, his present Majesty was
proclaimed King of these Realms, and very early afforded the most
impressive earnests of predilection for his native Land, its glory,
and its happiness.</p>

<p>The magnanimous benevolence of Englishmen was at this period
highly conspicuous to their distressed fellow-countrymen, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
prisoners in France, and whose sufferings from penury and nakedness
were of a kind the most extreme.</p>

<p>Sympathizing with their distresses, subscriptions were set on
foot, and it was not long ere they were relieved by the most liberal
supplies. The public generosity was not confined within the
pale of its own kindred, but was stretched forth even towards
our captive foes, whose wants were most imperious, but from which
their nation was unable to deliver them.</p>

<p>When we reflect upon such noble acts of fellow-feeling, the
man who is insensible to the reciprocal duties of fidelity and
gratitude, deserves not the virtuous title of a Briton. The world
also must cease to wonder at the many signal instances of Divine
interposition in favor of this little island, when it considers that
Providence is thus vindicating his own ways, in behalf of a people,
who are uniformly guided by the sacred precepts, and godlike impulse,
"of forgiving, and doing good to their enemies."</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>ighteen thousand three hundred and fifty-five Marines were
again voted as the establishment for 1761.</p>

<p>A secret expedition was prepared early in this year, which was
committed to the joint conduct of Major-General Hodgson and
Commodore Keppel, and was subsequently directed against the
island of Belleisle.</p>

<p>Eleven battalions of Foot, four troops of the 16th Light
Dragoons, under Lieutenant-Colonel Burgoyne, a detachment of the
Royal Artillery, and a corps of 1000 Marines formed into two
battalions, commanded by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel John Mackenzie,
amounting nearly to 10,000 men, composed the strength of
the Army upon this service. The whole were escorted and spiritedly
seconded by ten ships of the line, eight frigates, three
bomb ketches, and two fire ships; which set sail upon the 29th of
March from St. Helens, but did not gain sight of their wished for
object until the 6th of April. This force was afterwards augmented
by troops and men of war.</p>

<p>In addition to the natural strength of this island, no means of
defence had been neglected by the enemy, who, aware of the attack,
had constructed works, and placed guns on every spot, that afforded
a possibility of descent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the 7th the Fleet stood along the South end of Belleisle,
with a view to reconnoitre its strength, and to ascertain a proper
quarter for debarkation. Coming to anchor in the road of Palais
on the noon of that day, the principal Officers of both services,
accompanied by some of the Engineers, proceeded to the Northward,
in order to finish their observations upon the general state of the
coast. The final result convinced all, that great obstacles were to
be surmounted every where, and that the sacrifice of many lives
was unavoidable in attaining the first object of their views.</p>

<p>After mature deliberation, it was resolved to effect a landing
early in the morning of the 8th of April, for which purpose the
flat-bottomed boats were hoisted out, and the troops placed in them
ready to advance towards Port Andro, on a signal being made.
They were preceded by his Majesty's ships Dragon and Achilles,
commanded by the Hon. Captains Harvey and Barrington, whose
orders were to silence the battery, which protected the entrance into
this Bay. These gallant Officers soon accomplished the duty, and
intimated that no opposition to the landing of our forces was to be
dreaded from that point of defence.</p>

<p>The boats having proceeded under the immediate superintendance
of Commodore Keppel, who had shifted his pennant from the
Valiant into the Prince of Orange, were then ordered to row towards
the shore, arranged in three divisions, under the direction of Captain
Barton, of the Royal Navy. Notwithstanding a prodigious fire of
musquetry, our brave Soldiers made good their landing, and evinced
a series of valour that must have conquered any thing within the
power of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The French were intrenched to the chin on a steep hill, the
base of which they had cut into a perpendicular form, which
prevented our gallant fellows from ascending their works without
scaling-ladders, of which there were unfortunately none. After a
heavy loss, and a contest which did them honor, a retreat became
the only alternative.</p>

<p>On this trying occasion, the distinguished courage and coolness
of Generals Crawford and Carleton, were very highly conspicuous;
the latter was wounded.</p>

<p>One boat landed sixty of Erskine's Grenadiers, under Captain
Osborne, who were unobserved by the rest of our force, and not
being supported, fell victims, excepting twenty, to very superior
numbers, after the most noble resistance. Their brave leader was
classed among the unfortunate. The fire from the ships was opened to
cover the return of our troops, who sustained a loss of nearly 500 men.</p>

<p>A diversion was carrying on in another quarter during these
operations, in order to aid them, by attracting the enemy's force
from the real object of attack, towards Saucon. This was composed
of the 96th and 97th Regiments, and the Marines; but nothing
could avert the disaster.</p>

<p>A dreadful gale coming on after the return of the boats,
occasioned the loss of many of them, which was felt extremely;
and the transports were also very considerably damaged. After
it ceased, the attention of the whole Fleet was turned to repair
these accidents.</p>

<p>Having obtained some reinforcements, and after a second very
minute review of the island, it was determined to make another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
descent at Fort D'Arsic, to be supported by two separate attacks,
in order to distract the enemy, near St. Foy, and at Saucon.</p>

<p>The last, which was intended merely as a feint, was composed
of the four troops of Light Dragoons under Lieutenant-Colonel
Burgoyne; which being distributed amongst a number of transports,
and escorted by a large Naval Force, appeared the most formidable
of the whole. Ships of war were allotted to co-operate with the
other two, headed by Major-General Crawford and Brigadier
Lambert, in covering their debarkation and silencing the different
batteries.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 22d of April, the men of war
having accomplished this latter object, the troops were ordered by
signal to advance, in two divisions, in close order, till abreast of
their respective points of attack.</p>

<p>The enemy, suspecting that the principal impression would be
directed against Fort D'Arsic, overlooked the defence of these
stupendous rocks, which offered natural obstacles, sufficient to deter
the most daring invader.</p>

<p>Brigadier Lambert's division to which the Marines under Colonel
Mackenzie were attached, approached under this high coast, when
it appeared to this gallant Officer, that a fit opportunity for enterprize
presented itself. He accordingly moved onwards unperceived,
and with a rapid resolution, Captain Paterson, at the head of the
Grenadiers of the 19th Regiment, quickly supported by Captain
Murray, with a company of Marines, landed and climbed the rocks.
Soon afterwards other troops followed their intrepid example, when
having reached the summit, the whole formed upon it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
French were amazed at the attempt, but pushed on a veteran Corps
of 300 men to atone for their want of precaution.</p>

<p>Contiguous to the ground occupied by our troops, there was a
wall, which suggested itself as an eligible post of defence. This
enabled our inadequate numbers to oppose the enemy, until they were
farther reinforced by Brigadier Lambert, at the head of the Grenadiers
of the 30th, and the rest of the Marines under Colonel Mackenzie.
The tables were now turned, when the Regiment of Bigorre was
beat back to the rising ground from which it had advanced.</p>

<p>Captain Sir Thomas Stanhope, whose duty it was to co-operate
with this brigade, had watched these spirited efforts with an anxious
zeal. He instantly manned and armed all the boats of his squadron,
which rowed ashore as a farther support, while the force that had
proceeded against Fort D'Arsic, observing this unexpected success,
also pushed on to unite with Brigadier Lambert. Thus strengthened,
that active Officer allowed no interval, but moved against the
enemy upon the hill, whom he drove to their main body, taking
their field-pieces, and some prisoners.</p>

<p>Captain Paterson, of Beauclerck's regiment, Colonel Mackenzie
and Captain Murray of the Marines, were wounded; all of whom
were much distinguished during the whole course of this short,
but sharp service, which did not exceed the space of two hours.
About five in the evening the debarkation was completed, the
Army was pushed upwards of three miles into the country, and
took post upon an eminence through the night.</p>

<p>The enemy, during the day, had withdrawn all their detachments
from their extensive batteries on the coast, blown up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
magazines, and united all their forces under the command of
General de St. Croix.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23d, the British Army was in motion
against the town and citadel of Palais, while that of the French
occasionally seeming determined to dispute our progress, at last
retired without a conflict, into that strong fortress, and its dependant
works.</p>

<p>Some days of boisterous weather prevented the landing of our
battering cannon and other necessary stores, that were essential for
commencing operations against Palais, of which General St. Croix
availed himself, by constructing six different redoubts; all of which
were to be carried before breaking ground in front of the town
and citadel.</p>

<p>The English Commander also profited himself of this interval,
by dispersing assurances of protection to the laws, religion, and
property of the natives, who should submit themselves; which were
not without their effect. A short time, however, enabled General
Hodgson to employ more convincing arguments, by opening his
batteries upon the 2d of May. The brave St. Croix answer to
a summons was, that he would defend his charge to the last
extremity.</p>

<p>The enemy attempted a sortie on the night of the 3d against
our most advanced works, which they carried, killing a number
of our troops, and making General Crawford and both his Aids-de-Camp
prisoners. Following up this success, they advanced
against the trenches, when a sharp action commenced that remained
doubtful, until a party of Marines, under Captain Hepburn, arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
who charged the enemy, and forced them to retire with considerable
loss.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate our approaches, the Engineers pronounced
that it was absolutely necessary to carry one of the intervening
redoubts. Accordingly a detachment of 200 men composed of a part
of Loudon's regiment, and Marines, under Captain Carruthers, of
the latter corps, were warned, upon the evening of the 12th, for this
duty. A heavy fire, of shot and shells, was kept up during the
night upon that object, with a view to make some breach, and to
harass the enemy. Soon after the dawn of day, those assailants
advanced against the works with fixed bayonets, when, after a very
spirited contest, they soon carried the redoubt, and maintained it.
Captain Carruthers, with a ready promptitude, observing the panic
amongst the French, did not permit it to subside, but instantly
pushed on against two others, which were successively evacuated
by their defenders, who retreated with precipitation into the Citadel.
This party becoming reinforced by 370 of the 69th Regiment, under
Major Nesbit, achieved the conquest of the whole of the French
Redoubts, and with an impetuous persevering ardor entered the town
of Palais, pell mell, with the flying enemy.</p>

<p>The gallantry exhibited by all who fought on this memorable day,
very justly immortalized the military fame of every individual, which
extended its honorable influence to those corps at large, from whom
they were detached.</p>

<p>Very distinguished encomiums were bestowed by the enemy upon
"Les Petites Grenadiers;" a title derived from the caps worn by the
Marine Soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus was every obstacle removed, which prevented the close
investment of the Citadel of Palais; a fortress that had been planned
and raised under the superintending genius of the celebrated Vauban.</p>

<p>During this period the fleet rendered very material services, by
their stopping supplies from the Continent; and their vigilance
during the subsequent continuance of the siege was highly
meritorious.</p>

<p>The conduct of the French Commander reflected honour upon
himself and the French arms. From the 16th of May until the 7th of
June he persevered in maintaining his post against an unceasing fire
from 44 heavy cannon, 50 mortars and howitzers, besides field pieces,
which, in many places, ruined the works, killed numbers, and from
which there was no safe retreat but within the casemates.</p>

<p>This interval afforded the display of many instances of bold
intrepidity, amongst the individuals of the line and of my corps, from
the many sallies which were attempted by the active St. Croix,
during the course of it. One of these being aimed against a post
occupied by Captain Wright, of Marines, having under him three
Companies of his Corps, which was of peculiar importance, this brave
Officer, notwithstanding orders were given to retreat from it, assumed
a personal responsibility, and, well knowing its consequence in the
future operations of the Army, determined to maintain it. He
repulsed the enemy, and received the flattering sanction of Brigadier
General Howe, who, in the course of duty, afterwards visited it,
for has very resolute conduct.</p>

<p>Another conspicuous instance of this kind occurred in Lieutenant
Lachlan Cuthbert, of the Army, who evinced the greatest personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
courage, and though abandoned by his men, pointed and fired the
guns of a battery at which he commanded. Being soon supported,
the enemy were forced to retire with loss.</p>

<p>After an incessant cannonade, which had effected a large breach
sufficiently practicable to encourage a storm, preparations for it were
accordingly made; observing which, General St. Croix proposed to
capitulate, after a loss of 922 men within the walls of the Citadel,
upon the 7th of June.</p>

<p>In consequence of their gallant defence, honorable terms were
granted to the garrison, which was immediately shipped for France.</p>

<p>During the whole of this service, so highly creditable to our
Army, and to the corps of Marines, we have to recount 34 Officers,
30 Serjeants, 8 Drummers, and 710 Rank and File killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>General Howe was amongst the latter, as well as Brigadier
Carleton, already mentioned.</p>

<p>Much unanimity between the naval and land forces prevailed, and
the nation had to look with equal gratitude, to both, for the happy issue.</p>

<p>Major General Crawford being appointed Governor, and every
thing arranged, the troops that could be spared were afterwards
embarked for more distant duties.</p>

<p>The following orders were given out by the Commander in Chief
to the Army, sometime after the complete surrender of Belleisle:
"General Hodgson has the greatest pleasure to acquaint the Officers
and Soldiers under his command, with his Majesty's satisfaction
in the spirit, patience, and cheerfulness with which they have
sustained the fatigues of this siege."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Commodore Keppel in his public letter to the Right Honorable
Mr. Pitt, says, respecting the corps of Marines, "Major General
Hodgson by his constant approbation of the battalion of Marines
landed from the ships, and put under his command, gives me the
pleasing satisfaction of acquainting you of it, that his Majesty may
be informed of the goodness and spirited behaviour of that corps."</p>

<p>During the summer of this year, the Fleet and Army, under Sir
James Douglas, and Lord Rollo, reduced the island of Dominica,
which had maintained the assumed name of neutral, but had evinced
the most marked partiality for France; after a conference between
these joint Commanders, and the principal Natives, who at first
appeared much inclined to capitulate, the islanders, urged on by the
artifices of Mons. Longprie, the Governor, seemed resolved to defend
themselves.</p>

<p>The Ships soon moved close to the land, and, after a heavy
cannonade, silenced all the batteries, when the troops were pushed
ashore.</p>

<p>A successful and uninterrupted train of attack continued through
the whole day of the 6th of June, with but little loss on our part,
in which Lieutenant Colonel Melville, who led the grenadiers of the
Army, was much distinguished for promptitude and spirit. The
capture of the entire island, upon the 7th, was the effect of such
active energies.</p>

<p>Nothing farther was achieved during this year, that falls properly
under my review, in the light of conquests.</p>

<p>Numerous were the gallant single actions that were fought at
sea. One of the most prominent for daring spirit, and steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
perseverance occurred upon the 23d of January, between the Minerva,
commanded by Captain Alexander Hood, (now Lord Bridport), of
32 guns, and the Warwick, formerly a British ship of 60, but with
only 34 mounted.</p>

<p>Military exploits often derive their chief merit from the bold ideas
in which they originate. Such an application may well be advanced
on the present occasion, for the immense superiority of the enemy,
must have been early apparent to a seaman's eye. Captain Hood
was not intimidated at the view of a two decker, but continued the
chace, until he got close alongside. The Frenchman soon sustained
damage, which was succeeded by a much greater on the part of the
Minerva, in the serious loss of her bowsprit and foremast. These
being quickly cleared away, this zealous Officer moved once more
against the Warwick, and towards the close of day renewed the
combat. His brave exertions were crowned with success and with
honor; a share of which his modest recital, diffused amongst his
Officers, his Seamen, and Marines.</p>

<p>Another instance endeared to their Country, Captains Faulkener
and Logie, by a well fought engagement, which terminated in the
capture of the Courageux of 74 guns. The Bellona and Brilliant putting
into Lisbon to land the wounded, and to discharge their prisoners,
these unfortunate men applied to the Consul of France for relief, but
he would grant them none. The occasion called forth British
humanity, and they were relieved by those who had conquered them.</p>

<p>It would not have been so with the Seamen of England, who
kindly anticipates, and provides for the wants of those her valuable
servants, in every port, and in every clime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Commerce was also well protected, when we consider its
vast extent in every quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>This year carried within it a happy event, by the espousal of our
beloved Monarch to our most gracious Queen. It has fixed a long
train of succession to his throne, in a numerous and amiable family,
who yield to none of his Majesty's subjects in patriotism, and high
talents for the mingled duties of the Cabinet, the Ocean, and the
Camp.</p>

<p>France had shewn, apparently, a cordial wish for peace, but it
appeared principally from a motive to distract our Councils, and to
involve their Spanish Allies in the sad calamities of war. In both she
succeeded, for the Country lost one of her most faithful and zealous
servants in the Right Honourable Mr. Pitt, who resigned all his
employments, and early in the following year we had to combat an
additional foe.</p>

<p>At the close of 1761 the Field Officers upon the Marine
Establishment were Lieutenant Colonels Theo. Drury, Richard
Bendyshe, James Burleigh; Majors, Hector Boisrond, John Mackenzie,
John Pincell Kempe, Samuel Boucher, Edward Rycaut, John Tufton
Mason. There were also Majors by Brevet, John Campbell, Claud

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXV" id="CHAP_XXV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">O</span>n the 4th day of January, 1762, War was declared against
Spain, which was reciprocal on the part of that Power on the 18th,
and realized the acute forebodings of Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>A treaty framed for consolidating the interests and ambitious views
of the House of Bourbon, and evidently levelled against the existence
of our Empire, accelerated this event. So accustomed had the Nation
been to victory, however, that it beheld this mighty Family Compact
without dismay.</p>

<p>The public energies kept pace with the imperious occasion, and
70,000 Seamen, including 19,061 Marines, comprized in 135
companies, formed the naval establishment of the year.</p>

<p>A plan for the reduction of Martinico, digested by the late
Minister, was now carried into effect by the forces from North
America, who had finished a successful career upon that Continent,
by four battalions drawn from Belleisle, with strong detachments of
Seamen and Marines from the Fleet.</p>

<p>Sixteen sail of the line, and many ships of an inferior rate,
composed the escort which set sail from Barbadoes on the 5th of
January, and anchored in St. Anne's Bay on the 8th. The batteries
here were soon silenced by the ships, when Rear-Admiral Rodney
detached a squadron, with two brigades, to the Bay of Petite Ance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
having orders to debark and take post there, under the direction of
Generals Haviland and Grant; they were afterwards reinforced by
Lieutenant-Colonel Scott, with a Corps of Light Infantry.</p>

<p>Captain Harvey, in the Dragon, proceeded against the Grande
Ance, landed a few Seamen and all his Marines, who, by a combined
attack, carried the battery, and occupied it, till relieved by a
body of 800 men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Melville.</p>

<p>After destroying the works in St. Anne's Bay, the Admiral and
General Monckton, seeing the difficulties of extending their operations
from that quarter, followed to leeward, and reconnoitring the coast,
resolved upon landing the whole forces between Point Negro and
the Cas de Pilote. A squadron having cannonaded the line of
batteries, secured this object, when the Army was disembarked upon
the evening and morning of the 16th and 17th of January.</p>

<p>Nine hundred Marines, formed into two battalions, were united
with the troops attached to the Brigade of General Rufane, and had
an active share in the subsequent duties allotted to all.</p>

<p>The whole encamped on the heights above the Case de Navires,
from which the General employed detachments to throw up such
works as were necessary for covering the passage of the troops over
some intervening gullies, between them and the enemy on Morne
Tartenson.</p>

<p>The disposition of attack being made, Brigadier Grant began it
with the French advanced posts, at dawn on the morning of the
24th, while Brigadier Rufane advanced against their redoubts along
the sea coast upon the right, seconded by 1000 Seamen in flat-bottomed
boats, keeping pace with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Rollo's Brigade supported the Grenadiers, and General
Walsh with his, the Corps of Light Infantry, under Colonel Scott,
who was ordered to make a circuit, with a view to flank or get
behind the enemy. This essentially contributed to the success of
the day, as that body gained their left, and continued to incommode
it, while the Grenadiers were carrying every thing before them.</p>

<p>Brigadier Rufane performed his part with rapid and impetuous
success, being aided most spiritedly by the Seamen.</p>

<p>The final result of the day was gaining Morne Tartenson,
other subordinate works having many cannon, and driving the
fugitive enemy across a deep ravine, into the town of Fort Royal
and Morne Garnier.</p>

<p>General Haviland, with his Brigade, and two Battalions of
Highlanders, with a few Light Infantry, under Major Leland, were
directed to effect a passage over this gully, considerably to the left,
and cut off a detached force of the French from their main body.
Insurmountable difficulties, however, prevented this well-designed
combination; but they did not check their reaching in time to
support the Light Infantry, under Colonel Scott, in a very
important post which they had gained opposite to Morne Garnier;
while an upper plantation of consequence was occupied by Walsh's
brigade, and the Grenadiers. The space between these two was
filled by the Marines.</p>

<p>Batteries were opened on the 25th against the Citadel of Fort
Royal, which being much annoyed by the guns from Morne Garnier,
it was judged expedient to attack it on the left, where the Light
Infantry and Haviland's brigade were. Here cannon were opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
against it, in order to harass the enemy, and to ensure the future
passage of the ravine.</p>

<p>An attempt of the French on the evening of the 27th, signalized
this British outpost, which drove them back, not only across the gully,
but followed them and gained possession of their batteries, where
they established themselves; having been gallantly seconded by the
brigades of Walsh and Grant. Before nine at night the enemy had
abandoned this strong ground, and so precipitate was their retreat,
that they left behind them some serviceable ordnance and ammunition,
which were felt by the Citadel early next morning.</p>

<p>General Monckton, finding his batteries on Morne Tartenson
at too great a distance to produce material effect, resolved to push
on to Morne Capuchin, little more than 400 yards from the Citadel.
Observing this meditated essay, the enemy beat the chamade on
the evening of the 3d of February, and terms were signed on the 4th.</p>

<p>The testimonies of the Commanders in Chief to the respective
Corps were strong and animated. As usual, the services of the
Seamen were arduous in transporting cannon, and fearless amidst
dangers.</p>

<p>Monsieur De La Touche, the Governor General, who had
fallen back upon St. Pierre, with an intent of holding out, soon after
surrendered, and the extensive dependencies of that valuable island,
very early availed themselves of the benign and faithful tenders of
British protection.</p>

<p>The final consent of La Touche was much hastened by the
detaching Captain Harvey, in the Dragon, to the harbour of La
TrinitÃ©, where he landed some Seamen and his Marines, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
maintained their ground, and convinced the enemy how unavailing
would be their farther obstinacy.</p>

<p>This conquest, which added so much to the lustre of our arms,
was obtained at the expence of 7 Officers, 3 Serjeants, and 86 rank
and file killed, and 32 Officers, 20 Serjeants, and 337 rank and
file wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy experienced a loss of nearly 1000 men.</p>

<p>St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada, fell soon after, under
our dominion, and added to the commercial wealth of the
Nation.</p>

<p>Solid were the results that accrued from the repeated triumphs
of our Fleets and Armies, during this active year. The Revenue
was improved, while the individual became enriched by the conquered
territory, and the spoils of our enemies.</p>

<p>The rupture with Spain suggested immediate enterprize against
her distant and wealthy Colonies. In this plan, no little or inferior
views controuled our Councils, which boldly directed our force at
once, against the vitals, and the strong hold of her South American
Empire.</p>

<p>Lord Anson having submitted his ideas upon the accomplishment
of this great object, they were readily embraced upon the present
occasion, and adopted throughout.</p>

<p>The Fleet and Army which were destined to execute these
designs, were committed to Admiral Pococke, and the Earl of
Albemarle, who sailed from Portsmouth on the 5th day of March.
They took only a small force from England, as they were to
be joined by those troops who had achieved the conquest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
French Caribbee Islands, to be reinforced by auxiliaries from Jamaica
and North America; which, with the Marines of the Fleet that
were subsequently landed, constituted an Army little short of
15,000 men.</p>

<p>Admiral Pococke reached Martinique on the 26th of April,
where every thing was arranged, fascines made, the troops brigaded,
and 500 Negroes collected to perform the rough parts of these
laborious duties that were before them.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May the whole put to sea, and, on their passage to
leeward, were successively joined by the squadrons under Captain
Harvey and Sir James Douglas.</p>

<p>It was now that the superior talents and solicitous zeal of
Admiral Pococke appeared conspicuous. From the very advanced
season of the year no time could be sacrificed in fulfilling his
instructions, as dilatory measures might have proved ruinous, from
the setting in of the rains. Two alternatives were before him&mdash;a
tedious and circuitous navigation round the Island of Cuba,   or a
dangerous passage through the Old Straits of Bahama, hitherto
avoided by single ships, and at no period of the world explored
by so large a Fleet. The latter he chose, and it was crowned
with success.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June the Admiral brought to about five leagues
to the Eastward of the Havannah, to issue instructions; when having
confided the superintendance of disembarking the troops to Commodore
Keppel, he bore away for the mouth of the harbour.</p>

<p>The Marines were ordered into the boats early on the morning
of the 7th, as a feint, while the whole Army, under the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Albemarle, landed without opposition between the rivers Boca Nao
and Coximar, the latter of which was also passed, after Captain
Harvey, in the Dragon, had silenced a castle, that commanded
it.</p>

<p>Having a large garrison, headed by the most gallant Officers,
the enemy, though but recently apprized of this expedition, prepared
for the most vigorous defence.</p>

<p>Lord Albemarle, after some skirmishing in his progress, having
intimated, on the 10th, to the Admiral, his purpose of attacking
the Cavannos, situated on the east side of the harbour, and commanding
part of the Moro Fort, as well as the whole of the north
east of the City, with the strong works in that vicinity, Captain
Knight, in the Belleisle, was ordered against the Castle of Chorera,
to facilitate the enterprize, while the Marines were embarked in
boats to attract the enemy's attention towards the Havannah
quarter.</p>

<p>This service was ably performed by Colonel Carleton, on
the noon of the 11th, at the head of the Grenadiers and Light
Infantry.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were not only driven into the Moro, but they
also abandoned the Castle of Chorera; which allowed our immediately
breaking ground on the advantageous site of the Cavannos.
Never were greater obstacles encountered and overcome, than
through the whole series of this siege. The Seamen were highly
active in landing the cannon, manning the batteries, and supplying
the Army with water, on a spot that yielded not a drop. Much
harmony prevailed throughout these fatigues between the services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 13th, 800 Marines were landed, formed into two
Battalions, under Majors Campbell and Collins, and attached to
the command of Colonel and Adjutant General William Howe, upon
the Chorera side.</p>

<p>Owing to the thinness of soil upon the Cavannos it was not until
the 29th of June that our batteries could open against the Moro.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a superiority of fire on shore, Captain Harvey,
in the Dragon, having under him two other ships, volunteered to
place them against that Castle, which he did, in the most gallant
stile, upon the morning of the 1st of July. By this diversion the
object was gained, but with the loss of Captain Coostrey of the
Cambridge, and 161 killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The labour of many days was destroyed by a fire that broke out
from the dryness of the fascines, and the cannonade kept up, upon
the 2d, which was not extinguished until the night of the 5th.</p>

<p>Such an unfortunate casualty depressed, but did not conquer the
spirits of our men, who were additionally exposed to the most
extreme fatigue, a scanty supply of water, and unwholesome
provisions.&mdash;They had also to encounter an enemy in Don Velasco,
worthy of his important trust.</p>

<p>Fortunately Sir James Douglas arrived from Jamaica with some reinforcements,
which were soon followed by others from North America.</p>

<p>It falls not within my scope to enter minutely into the protracted
events of this siege, which was carried on and sustained by both sides,
with unexampled perseverance, and steady valour.</p>

<p>About one o'clock in the afternoon of the 30th of July, by the
explosion of one of our advanced mines, a practicable breach for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
file in front was effected, which was soon noticed, and assaulted by
our troops, at the head of which was Lieutenant Forbes, of the Royal
Scotch. Many of the Spanish Soldiers were within the casemates,
and little anticipated so bold an attempt, but they were soon under
arms, and encouraged to their duty by their brave Chiefs Don
Velasco, and the Marquis Gonzales. Both these Gentlemen fell on
the occasion; the former surviving only for a short time, the effects of
a mortal wound. The Moro was soon carried, which led to the final
conquest of the Havannah, and its dependencies upon the 13th of
August. Twelve sail of the line, and a large treasure, were its
immediate fruits.</p>

<p>Although nothing peculiarly brilliant fell to the lot of the corps of
Marines co-operating in the fatigues of this arduous campaign, still their
zeal and discipline kept pace with the other classes of his Majesty's
servants, and justly entitled them to a share of that gratitude,
bestowed in general terms to all, by their Leaders and their Country.</p>

<p>A predatory attempt against Newfoundland, by a squadron that
stole out of Brest, under Mons. Ternay, having on board two
regiments, was the only offensive operation on the part of the French
during the year 1762.</p>

<p>This Officer might have tried his fortune in a manner far more
suitable to the interests and dignity of his Country by aiming a blow
at our East, West India, and North American convoys, protected
by a very inferior force to his, instead of prosecuting a relentless fury
against the insignificant garrison of St. John, and the tackle and
stages of our poor, but industrious fishermen. Captain (afterwards
Vice Admiral) Joshua Rowley, in the Superbe of 74 guns, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Gosport of 44, Captain Jervis, (now Earl St. Vincent), and the Danae
of 38, Captain Henry Martin, having charge of these valuable fleets,
were chaced by Mons. Ternay, on the 11th of May, having under
him two line of battleships, two heavy frigates, and a bomb-ketch.
The steady countenance of Commodore Rowley, who formed into
order of battle, convinced the Frenchman that he must wade through
a bloody and perhaps a successless conflict, before he could reach his
object. The precarious issue induced Mons. Ternay to be off, and
to pursue his course for less dangerous game.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, the garrison of St. John, with a
number of contiguous posts in no state to make resistance&mdash;fell without
a contest on the 25th of June. Captain (afterwards Lord), Greaves who
was then at Placentia, on the South East part of the island, landed his
Marines from the Antelope and prepared for defence; at the same
time he apprized our Commanders at Halifax and New York of his
situation, and solicited immediate support.</p>

<p>Lord Colville soon joined him, when, after disembarking a number
of Marines as a farther reinforcement, with his very inferior squadron,
he went out to meet the enemy on the 22d of August, and proceeded
off St. John's to give him battle.</p>

<p>The French having adopted a system of plunder and destruction
along the coast, wherever they could with impunity, his Lordship
detached an Officer and 30 Marines to the Island of Boys, which spot,
that party had the honor to defend for his Majesty. During this period
the works at St. John's had been much strengthened.</p>

<p>In consequence of the invasion and intelligence of it reaching
North America, a force was detached under Lieutenant Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Amherst, which reached the coast of Newfoundland upon the 11th
of September.</p>

<p>After a train of sharp and active services, on the part of the Army,
in which the Navy co-operated, St. John's was recovered upon the
18th, and the whole island was freed from those freebooters, who,
in turn, became prisoners.</p>

<p>A friendly fog which had covered Mons. Ternay's departure from
France, was also auspicious in his escape from that harbour. His
conduct through the whole of this expedition was marked alike by
cautious timidity, in the sight of his enemies, as by oppressive
inhumanity over those he had conquered.</p>

<p>The acute observations, and active talents of Sir William Draper,
not only laid the foundation, but were highly conducive towards the
success of one of the boldest designs, that was ever patronized by a
British Ministry. That Officer, after the most approved good
conduct, during the siege of Madrass, had leave to retire to Canton in
China, on account of extreme bad health. It was here that his
enquiries commenced about the state of the Spanish Philippine Islands,
and he had complete intelligence both as to their commercial
importance, and military defence. This he treasured up for his
Country, against the day of emergency, by whom he was amply
recompenced for such early zeal, by his suggestions being eagerly
embraced, and he employed to execute them.</p>

<p>A disclosure of such a nature, however, would not have been
received, but spurned at, by our Cabinet during a period of tranquillity
with Spain. The whole continued dormant within the breast of
Sir William Draper, till hostilities were inevitable, when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
dispatched in the Argo, for the East Indies, with the most liberal
powers to carry this object into effect.</p>

<p>Arriving towards the close of June, he lost not a moment in
arranging every thing for the expedition against Manilla. The
whole set sail on the 1st of August, consisting of a mixed force
of nearly 1330 men. As so small a number could only look for
success in the unprepared state of the enemy, hitherto confident in
their security, and in the promptest measures, a ship of war was
detached into the entrance of the Chinese Sea, in order to stop
all communication of our project.</p>

<p>The Fleet reached Malacca on the 27th of August, where
they watered, finished a number of gabions for the future operations
of the Army, and finally anchored in Manilla Bay on the 23d of Sept.</p>

<p>Admiral Cornish had appointed 550 Seamen, and 300 Marines,
to co-operate with the Land Forces, which were formed into separate
battalions.</p>

<p>After an ineffectual summons sent to the town, and the coast
reconnoitred, no time was to be lost in keeping up that surprize
which had apparently struck the enemy.</p>

<p>A proper spot, two miles to the southward of Manilla, having
been selected for the debarkation, the 79th Regiment, all the
Marines, and the Artillery, with some field pieces, and one howitzer,
were formed into three divisions, under the sterns of three frigates,
which were ordered to cover the landing.</p>

<p>Captains Parker, Kempenfelt, and Brereton, of the Royal
Navy, were entrusted with the conduct of each of them, who
discharged the duty with much ability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Numbers of the Spanish Indians having assembled to dispute
our descent, the ships of war opened their fire, which compelled
them to retire. A violent surf dashed many of the boats to pieces,
and injured the musquets, but the troops established themselves at a
village named Malata, little more than a mile from the enemy's
works, during the night of the 24th.</p>

<p>On the 25th a detachment was advanced to occupy a fort which
was abandoned, called Polverista, and Major Monson was pushed
forward to take possession of Hermita Church, a small distance from
the City, of much local consequence, both as to natural strength,
and as a shelter from the heavy rains that had already set in.
The 79th Regiment was farther ordered to reinforce this post.</p>

<p>Much praise was due to the Seamen for their unparalleled
exertions in landing the remaining troops, cannon, and stores, amidst
a most dreadful surf, and the heaviest rains.</p>

<p>The Marines were left at the first posts, the Malata and the
Polverista, with a view to secure the retreat of the advanced forces,
if necessary; to preserve a mutual communication with the ships,
and to guard the stores and heavy artillery. "<i>They</i>," says Sir
William Draper, "from the good conduct and example of their
Officers, behaved very well, and were of great use upon all
occasions."</p>

<p>Considering the strength of Manilla, and the numbers employed
against it, no regular siege could be undertaken, or could an
observance of the systematic rules of approach be followed. The
Spaniards were extremely languid in every effort of defence, while
our united forces evinced the most undaunted spirit and unshaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
perseverance, during a series of attacks from the native Indians, and
of laborious toils amidst winds and rain.</p>

<p>After having made a practicable breach, it was resolved to storm
the place upon the 6th of October, and it was executed with that
bold ardour which is the native birth-right of Englishmen.</p>

<p>Were my limits to allow, with pleasure would I particularize
such exertions, and the gallant actors in them. I can only say,
that through the whole the Soldier and Sailor felt no jealousy but
that of being foremost in danger and in discipline.</p>

<p>Humanity mingled with policy, influenced the Commanders in
Chief to avert from the City the calamity of promiscuous plunder,
by a pecuniary compromise for its protection. The laws of war
sanctioned this vengeance, from its having fallen by storm. The
conquerors here, became ennobled by compassion, and they stipulated
to save the property of unoffending individuals, while they at the
same time consulted their Country's honor and her interests.</p>

<p>To the eternal disgrace of the Spanish Nation, this generous
compact continues unfulfilled.</p>

<p>The Port of Cavite, with the other dependencies of Manilla,
were included in the capitulation, and Captain Champion, with
100 Marines, and some Seapoys, were detached as a garrison to
the former.</p>

<p>Our total loss upon this brilliant service was 4 Officers, 1 Serjeant,
and 29 Privates killed; 1 Lieutenant drowned; and 6 Officers,
3 Serjeants, and 102 rank and file wounded. Among the first
were 5 Marines, and the latter, Lieutenant Spearing, besides 6
Privates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The East India Company, in consequence of the aids they had
afforded, was entitled to one third of the settled ransom, which was
four millions of dollars; and the acquired conquest was given up to
its servants in trust for his Majesty.</p>

<p>Such united harmony existed between the naval and land services,
that they agreed to share their fortunes mutually, afloat and ashore.</p>

<p>From the intelligence gained at Manilla, the Admiral detached
a force to intercept the annual galleon. The Panther and Argo
overtook the ship which had sailed from that place, on the 1st of
August, much to their surprize, instead of the one that had been
expected there. Nearly three millions of dollars were on board
the Sanctissima Trinidad, which were defended with much
obstinacy, but she was at last compelled to strike.</p>

<p>Both Commanders, upon the Manilla expedition, very meritedly
received the public thanks of their Country, and the honorable marks
of a Sovereign's gratitude.</p>

<p>Immense captures were made at sea, and repeated were the
occasions which displayed the British naval character during this
year, so fertile in momentous events.</p>

<p>Amongst these may be reckoned the Hermione, worth one
million sterling, the treasure of which enriched the crews of two sloops
of war, and was carried in proud triumph through the streets of
London, the very hour in which the Heir Apparent to the British
Throne was ushered into the world. A Marine shared upwards of
500<i>l</i>. from this capture.</p>

<p>The enemy, discomfited in every quarter, were not ashamed to
own their weakness, and they were the first to sue for peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>A few short months had alienated or destroyed a great portion
of the Spanish Navy, had given a deep wound to their Commerce,
which would have been most sensibly felt under a continuance of
hostilities, and had convinced Europe and the World, that the
resources of Britain could only be estimated amidst accumulating
dangers, and that her native spirit could only be known amidst
increasing difficulties.</p>

<p>During the whole of this memorable war, the Marine Soldier
not only shared in the everlasting glory of our Fleets, but carried
with him, through all the mingled destinies of his profession, a
steady discipline, combined with a well-regulated valour. Excepting
the drawn battle off Minorca, not a naval action was fought in
which he did not bear a part, and there were but few of our
widely-extended conquests that do not, in their detail, recognize
his name.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of a peace, which are not my business to
discuss, upon the 3d of November, and ratified in February of the
following year, closed the military services of the Marine Corps
for a long period, until they were again drawn forth into action by
an enlightened patron, who had marked their conduct, and who
resolved to avail himself of their animated zeal and spirit, upon
the earliest emergency that his Country required them.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXVI" id="CHAP_XXVI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he era of peace was marked, as usual, by a general reduction
of his Majesty's servants.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1763, a very considerable and impolitic
diminution took place in the effective force of Marines; but as it is
a narrow system, which experience and their acknowledged utility
have subverted, at the period I now write, any discussion upon its
erroneous principle would be superfluous and unbecoming.</p>

<p>As I have already noticed that the Field Officers of my Corps
are peculiarly calculated for maintaining discipline and good order
throughout, it is a matter of surprize that the establishment should
have been so very low at this time, and that their situations should
have been more generally considered as posts of sinecure than of
active duty.</p>

<p>The meritorious services of the Marine Corps, during the late
brilliant contest, well entitled it to <i>some solid</i> marks of public
recompence, as well as of public applause.</p>

<p>With this view, and striking home to the national gratitude, as
yet unallayed by time, the following proposals for increasing the
number of established Marine Field Officers were ushered in to the
Board of Admiralty in 1763:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Proposals for increasing the number of established Marine
Field Officers from six to fifteen, at a very inconsiderable additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
expence to the public. The Field Officers to have
Companies, and to serve on their present pay until six Companies
become vacant; those Companies to be given to the six senior Field

<p>The above would have been a moderate number of Field Officers
to regulate the divisional duties, and to superintend the discipline of
70 Companies, consisting of 4287 men; to which the corps was
reduced by a legislative vote at the close of 1763. Whether from
dissent as to the expediency, or a non-compliance with the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of these suggestions, is immaterial, but they were unnoticed, although
their propriety and justice did not escape the discriminating and
liberal mind of Earl Sandwich, whose distinguished talents introduced
him to the naval councils of his Country, and whose elevated rank
in them, enabled him to controul those necessary reforms at a
subsequent era.</p>

<p>A commendable but limited policy, in providing for the discharged
servants of the state, prevailed at the close of this war, by holding out
the inducements of land in the ceded province of Canada, to such
Officers, Sailors, and Soldiers <i>only</i> who had aided in its subjection.</p>

<p>When we contemplate the <i>connection</i> that exists, in the events of
war, how much local conquests are often promoted by the use of
extraordinary energies in quarters distant from the scene of good
fortune, like the judicious diversions and stratagems of an active
Officer, to promote his real designs, no principle ought to restrain
such national grants to the partial few who have been the happy
agents of success.</p>

<p>It is an old axiom&mdash;<i>that America was subdued in Germany</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he genius of discovery, and commerce, began to supersede that of
war in 1764 and many ensuing years.</p>

<p>Circumstances, however, very early occurred within the North
American Provinces, which developed the genuine spirit of the people,
and afforded the presage of future broils.</p>

<p>Gratitude to a Mother Country, who had delivered those Colonists
from the terrors of a hostile and restless neighbour, had scarcely
cooled throughout that Continent, when the example of New England,
long famed for a bias to republican principles, began to evince an
opposition to the laws of a parent, by whom they had been so long
protected, and under which they continued to flourish.</p>

<p>Happy had it been for Britain, if, at this period of lurking danger,
her councils had been guided by a purer consistency, and a more
elevated dignity; but a fatal irritation, succeeded by concession, were
but injudicious means to subdue, or to appease a spirit that began to
cherish the ideas of future emancipation.</p>

<p>Political discussions fall not within my province, but as being
introductory to that issue which compels an appeal to the sword. The
events of 1765, led to the American rebellion, and as but very few
incidents appear at all connected with my subject, my review, upon
this interval of time being uninteresting, must of course be concise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The Marine Soldier was naturally a companion in these dangers
and hardships which marked the progress of those scientific characters,
who were employed by an enlightened Country, in fixing
the intercourse between man and man, in exploring regions hitherto
unknown, and in extending the dominions and the commerce of
their native island.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, he was obliged reluctantly to draw the
trigger against the uncivilized savage&mdash;but it was his duty, and only
in self-defence.</p>

<p>It was not until the year 1771 that the Corps of Marines felt
the fostering influence of a patron and a friend.</p>

<p>Earl Sandwich, placed at the head of the Admiralty, was
now enabled to realize a system he had long entertained in his
thoughts; he beheld us orphans, and he adopted us as his children.</p>

<p>From him originated the <i>Colonels Commandant</i> of Divisions, and
many of these interior regulations, which, for their Åconomy and
wisdom, do honor to the establishment.</p>

<p>His Lordship, by a Memorial to the Throne, soon after his
accession to power, obtained an order of Council to enlarge the
number of Field Officers.</p>

<p>These happy reforms held out a hope to the veteran, from which
he had till now been precluded, that of being at the head of a
Division.</p>

<p>By a train of considerate attentions the Corps was placed on a
respectable footing, its discipline became much improved, and his
Lordship soon saw those objects of his tender care, surpassed by no
troops in the world, for subordination, intrepidity, and cool valour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing farther which attaches to my detail appears on the face
of public events, until Britain again unsheathed the sword, to
assert the rights of supremacy over her North American Colonies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXVIII" id="CHAP_XXVIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">F</span>rom the era of 1764, we may date the fatal American rebellion,
and those revolutionary principles which have long continued,
and what still menace the quiet and independence of Europe, and
the World.</p>

<p>Political topics, from that period, were predominant amongst
the Colonists, and all who know how easy it is to sway popular
prejudices, will readily allow it is as little difficult to give them
action.</p>

<p>Grievances, whether real or imaginary, which is not my business
to decide, unceasingly agitated the public mind, weaned by degrees
every filial affection, and from their tedious speculative existence,
they implanted within the breasts of many, the lurking sentiments
of jealous rancour. Such in their progress became principles, and
those men, very early, either filled the Armies of North America,
or guided her Councils.</p>

<p>A public character, much respected for his private as well as
military virtues, was placed at Boston. General Gage, from a
long residence upon the Continent, was well qualified to allay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
general ferment; but it was too deeply rooted, and the duty he
owed his King, was soon necessarily paramount to every other
consideration.</p>

<p>In the year 1774 an assemblage of troops, under that Officer,
gave umbrage not only to the Bostonians, but to their surrounding
neighbours, and the placing of a guard at the Neck, which is
the narrow isthmus that joins the Peninsula to the Continent,
afforded an additional cause of suspicion.</p>

<p>At this time, and from a very trifling circumstance, a spirit of
military union, and also of hostility, was peculiarly apparent among
the New Englanders. A report, very industriously propagated, and
seemingly with a view to probe the general feelings, gained ground,
that the British had occupied the Neck, had cut off all communication
with the Continent, in order to compel the inhabitants of
Boston into the unlimited assent of every measure. This being
spread abroad, the adjacent country assembled, intimated to the
people within the town their readiness to assist them; but that if
they should sacrifice <i>their</i> liberties, such an inglorious compact
would extend no farther.</p>

<p>They moreover avowed their intentions of combining together in
what manner and form they chose for mutual security.</p>

<p>Every thing foreboding hostile events, General Gage fortified
the Neck at Boston, and as precautionary steps he also seized upon
the provincial arsenal at Cambridge, and the powder lodged in the
magazines of Charlestown.</p>

<p>These measures were sufficient to rouse the popular indignation,
in no want of inflammatory materials; but although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
they might not have been political, they were still, however, expedient,
under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>To ascertain the views and opinions of so many provinces,
different in their manners, and in some respects opposite in their
interests, a general Congress was held at Philadelphia, on the 5th
of September, 1774, by deputies from the whole. Their proceedings
were marked by moderation, but by firmness.</p>

<p>The terms of conciliation arising from them having been rejected
by the mother country, his Majesty communicated a message,
recommending the augmentation of his forces, by sea and land.</p>

<p>The union which pervaded America, sufficiently proves how
widely popular had been the resolves of their deputies. These were
almost every where the political creed of the Colonies, and the crowd.</p>

<p>Things arrived at such a crisis early in 1775, that the die could not
be long suspended. A trivial affair, upon the 26th of February, shewed
by what a slender thread the tranquillity of the Empire hung, and
although it was not accompanied by any act of hostility, still it tended
to ground a mutual antipathy between the Soldier and the Native.</p>

<p>General Gage having learned that some brass guns had been
collected in the town of Salem, sent a detachment in order to bring
them to Boston. Landing at Marblehead, they continued their
march towards the place of destination, but not finding the cannon,
which had been removed, they penetrated farther into the country
in quest of them.</p>

<p>In the course of their route there was a draw-bridge, which the
numerous populace on the other side had taken up, on purpose to
stop the passage of the troops. An order from the Commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Officer to let it down was disobeyed, who attempted to seize on a
boat, in order to get possession of the bridge. A scuffle ensued, but
nothing occurred which could be denominated sanguinary force. This
was owing to the address of a neighbouring Clergyman, who, while
he consulted the feelings of an Officer in prosecuting his instructions,
also expostulated with him who headed the detachment, upon the
endless and calamitous results if blood was spilt. Appealing to the
people also, he invoked them to concede their point, which, for a
short time, delayed the awful quarrel.</p>

<p>This party returned without success, but without mischief.</p>

<p>A body of Marines was at Boston, under Major Pitcairne,
whose personal destiny it was to be employed in the first hostile act,
which eventually involved the separation of Britain and America.</p>

<p>At the town of Concord, where the provincial Congress was
held, a quantity of military stores having been collected, the Commander
in Chief ordered the Grenadiers and Light Infantry of the
Army, under Lieut. Col. Smith, and Major Pitcairne, to destroy them.</p>

<p>They embarked during the night of the 18th of April, and
proceeding up Charles River, landed at Phipp's Farm, from whence
they advanced, with silent rapidity, towards Concord. The country,
however, was alarmed before the dawn of day, and on the arrival
of the British at Lexington, the Militia of that town was assembled,
under arms, at five in the morning.</p>

<p>An English Officer, in the van, called out, "Disperse, you
rebels;" when our soldiery, firing a few partial shots, a general
discharge followed, by which some were both killed and wounded.
A mutual recrimination upon the score of first aggression, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
afterwards agitated, which, instead of staying, only tended to
stimulate the spirit of war.</p>

<p>Colonel Smith having pushed forward some Companies of Light
Infantry, before his arrival at Concord, in order to secure two bridges,
by which the Provincials might carry off the stores, another body of
Militia that appeared on a hill in their route, retired at the approach
of the British troops, across one of them, who soon after possessed
themselves of both.</p>

<p>The main body were, in the mean time, employed in destroying
every military article within the town.</p>

<p>The American Militia, observing some conflagration of houses
in Concord, immediately returned to one of the bridges they had
recently passed, when the Light Infantry occupied the side of the
river towards that place. On the approach of the Provincials the
former fired, which was soon returned.</p>

<p>After a skirmish, the English detachment fell back, with the loss
of some killed and wounded, besides one Lieutenant and a few other
prisoners.</p>

<p>About this time the whole country was in one state of alarm,
which compelled an immediate retreat to Lexington. This was
effected under the disagreeable circumstances of a hot day, and an
incessant fire from the hourly collecting numbers in the rear of the
troops, and from houses, walls, and every hidden place of defence,
in their front and flanks.</p>

<p>Lord Percy had most judiciously been detached from Boston very
early in the morning of the 19th, with a reinforcement of sixteen
Companies, and a body of Marines. This force arrived at Lexington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
just in time to afford a respite to Colonel Smith's detachment,
now much harassed by fatigue, and overpowered by very superior
numbers.</p>

<p>Having two field pieces, they kept the rebels in awe, until the
British resumed their march towards Boston. Major Pitcairne's horse
was twice wounded very severely, and he made some narrow escapes
during these tumultuous attacks.</p>

<p>Lord Percy, who had advanced to Lexington, by the way of
Cambridge, with a penetration and foresight that reflected high honour
upon his military talents, determined upon returning to Boston by a
different route. The numerous hordes of Americans who had
collected on the expected line of his retrograde march, were by this
foiled in their hopes of blood, as his Lordship most judiciously turned
off towards Charlestown, where he was not looked for, and gained
the heights of Bunker's Hill, whither they durst not follow him.
To this happy manÅuvre the whole detachment owed its salvation,
and Boston also may acknowledge his Lordship as its preserver at
that early and important crisis.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this toilsome service, our loss was by no
means equal to the seeming dangers, being only 65 killed, 2 Lieutenants
and 20 men taken prisoners, and Colonel Smith, besides some other
Officers, and about 174 wounded. Thus was the fatal torch lighted,
and it never was extinguished but with American independence.</p>

<p>The whole Country was now roused to arms, and General Gage,
with his little army, became invested, within the works of Boston.</p>

<p>Earl Sandwich, who presided at the Board of Admiralty, sensible
of the high state of discipline, to which the corps of Marines had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
reached, pushed them early into the American War. Their conduct
upon every duty, reflected credit upon his Lordship's discernment.</p>

<p>In addition to those under Major Pitcairne, who were attached to
Lord Percy's Brigade, a farther reinforcement arrived at Boston in
the month of May, commanded by Major Short.</p>

<p>It is a tribute justly due to those Officers who so very gallantly
supported their Country's honor, and their own, to detail their names,
and battalions, agreeably to the arrangement issued in public orders,
at Boston, upon the 20th of May.</p>

<p class="pad2">Battalion orders,</p>

<p>"The Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty having directed a reinforcement of Marines to serve
under Major Pitcairne, in General Gage's Army, consisting of the
following number: 2 Majors, 10 Captains, 27 Subalterns,
2 Adjutants, 1 Surgeon, 2 Surgeon's Mates, 28 Serjeants, 25
Corporals, 20 Drummers, 600 Privates.</p>

<p>"The Commanding Officer finds it necessary, for the good of
the service, to form the whole under his command, into two
Battalions.</p>

consequences. Many resolutions and measures were adopted by the
Colonists, that aimed at the dissolution of every united tie, and even
at independance.</p>

<p>General Gage, also, issued a Proclamation in his Majesty's name,
extending the offers of pardon to all who should return to their
allegiance, excepting Messrs. Samuel Adams and John Hancock.
Little hope of reconciliation being entertained, both sides began to
prepare in right earnest, for hostilities.</p>

<p>The rebels wishing to anticipate the Royal troops, in the
possession of Charlestown,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> hitherto unoccupied by either, pushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>a large body of men, on the evening of the 16th of June, to erect
works upon Bunker's Hill. During the night they raised entrenchments,
and a breast work, with a strong redoubt, sufficiently
formidable to excite the jealousy of General Gage. A heavy fire
opened upon their working parties early on the morning of the 17th of
June, who, however, persevered in their labours with much firmness.</p>

<p>It appearing highly necessary to dislodge the Americans from so
very important a post, the Commander in Chief, at noon, detached
ten Companies of Grenadiers, an equal number of Light Infantry,
with the 5th, 38th, 43d, and 52d regiments, under Major Gen. Howe
and Brigadier Pigot, with that view, which being embarked, landed
and formed on the Peninsula, without opposition, under cover of the
ships of war.</p>

<p>The position of the rebels was strong indeed. A small but well
contrived redoubt, besides some other works full of soldiers, and
defended with cannon, as well as numbers of rifle men placed in the
houses of Charlestown, covered their right flank; their centre and
left were protected by a breast work, partly gun proof, which reached
from the redoubt, to the Medford River.</p>

<p>Major General Howe, upon examining this powerful state of
defence, and observing fresh columns pouring in to the enemy's
works, solicited a reinforcement, which soon joined him, consisting
of some Companies of Grenadiers and Light Infantry, the 47th
regiment, and the first battalion of Marines.</p>

<p>Having been formed in two lines, they advanced with slow but
steady steps to the conflict. Majors Pitcairne, Tupper, and Short,
led my corps upon this distinguished day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The roar of cannon and howitzers, on the part of the British,
occasionally halting to yield them effect, marked their progress
towards the rebel works. Not a shot was returned by the enemy,
until our troops had nearly reached their entrenchments, when a
tremendous and destructive fire was opened, which, it must be
confessed, somewhat staggered our men. The awful occasion
exhibited General Howe most conspicuously for the valuable resources
of coolness and reflection amidst danger. It also afforded an
opportunity of signalizing the discipline and intrepidity of the
Battalion of Marines, which dealt destruction and carnage around
them.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Pigot, who was destined to attack the redoubt
and lines, that covered the American right flank, was likewise
exposed to a hot fire from the houses in Charlestown. His loss was
severe, but his exertions were animated, and displayed the most
brilliant courage, as well as talents.</p>

<p>General Clinton, who had crossed from Boston during the action,
attached to himself the merit of rallying the troops, whom he led
against the rebel works with fixed bayonets, and with that daring
impetuosity which so strongly characterizes the British Soldier.</p>

<p>They soon forced them, and drove the Provincials across the
neck of Charlestown, who were also much harassed by the cannon
of his Majesty's ship Glasgow, in their retreat.</p>

<p>The Glory of the Army, upon this day, was great, but it was
dearly earned. Their total loss amounted to 1 Lieutenant Colonel,
2 Majors, 7 Captains, and 9 Subalterns of the land forces and Marines
killed; besides 70, of different descriptions in both, wounded. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
hundred and seven Non-commissioned and rank and file also fell,
and 828 were wounded.</p>

<p>Amongst the slain was Major Pitcairne, of the Marines, whose
death was alike deplored by his Corps and his Country. Major Short
also left behind him a reputation sufficiently worthy of deep regret.</p>

<p>The Marine Battalion sustained fully more than its proportional
share of casualties, and its gallant conduct upon the 17th of June,
demands, from the whole of our Establishment, its commemorative
and indelible gratitude, when each of us casts an eye upon that
laurel which now encircles his button, and reflects that it was purchased
<i>by their valour</i>.</p>

<p>The following appeared in the General Orders of the 19th of
June, 1775:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Commander in Chief returns his most grateful thanks to
Major-General Howe, for the extraordinary exertion of his military
abilities on the 17th instant. He returns his thanks also to
Major-General Clinton, and Brigadier Pigot, for the share they
took in the success of the day, as well as to Lieutenant-Colonels
Nesbitt, Abercromby, Gunning, and Clarke; Majors Butler,
Williams, Bruce, <i>Tupper</i>, Spenlove, Small, and Mitchel, and
the rest of the Officers and Soldiers, who, by remarkable efforts
of courage and gallantry, overcame every disadvantage, and
drove the rebels from the redoubt and strong holds on the heights
of Charlestown, and gained a complete victory."</p>

<p>By the return of Major Tupper to Europe, and the fatal events
of the 17th of June, the command of the Marines soon after devolved
upon Major (now Lieutenant-General) Souter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Bunker's Hill was fortified, and our troops retained the Peninsula,
which rendered their duties very severe. The Americans prevented
every supply from the interior, and compelled our Army to subsist
upon salt, and indifferent provisions. Cut off from the Continent,
their sufferings were great, when sickness became prevalent.</p>

<p>The Provincials having constructed works upon a hill opposite
Bunker's, completed the blockade of the Peninsula, which
they gradually extended close to the fortifications on Boston
Neck.</p>

<p>Some predatory enterprizes were attempted by them, by no means
deficient in spirit or success. In one of these they burnt the light-house
at the entrance of the harbour, communicating with it by
some whale boats from which they carried off, or killed, the whole
of a small detachment of Marines, who protected the carpenters in
erecting a new one. Thus matters continued for some time, and
the situation of a brave Army, cooped up and unable to act, was
rendered both distressing and degrading.</p>

<p>In the orders of the 27th of September, the Royal thanks were
tendered to the forces, for their intrepid conduct upon the 17th of
June, in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The King has been pleased to order the Commander in
Chief, to express his Majesty's thanks, both to the Officers and
Soldiers, for the resolution and gallantry with which they attacked
and defeated the rebels on the 17th of June last, who had every
advantage of numbers and situation; and more especially expressed
to the Generals Howe and Clinton, and to Brigadier General
Pigot, the sense his Majesty entertains of the spirit, resolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and conduct by which they distinguished themselves, to their
honor, upon that day."</p>


<p>The <i>Battalion Orders</i> of that day, also contained the annexed
communications:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The King has been pleased to make the following promotions
in his Marine Forces, serving in North America:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was farther intimated upon the same day, "That in consequence
of the application of Major Pitcairne to have the same
allowance for paying the Companies of the 1st and 2d Battalions
of Marines, serving on shore in North America, as the Army
have, and that the Captains should be answerable for the debts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, ever ready to
give every reasonable mark of their indulgence, were pleased to
consent that each Captain, commanding a Company, should be
allowed after the rate of 1s. per day; being equal to the pay of
two men per Company, during their continuance on shore, as is
practised in the Army; and the Deputy Paymaster is authorized
to issue the same.</p>

<p>"The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased
to approve Major Pitcairne's appointing Mr. Smith Quarter-Master
to the 2d Battalion of Marines."</p>

<p>General Washington having been appointed to command the
Armies of America, he, in company with Major General Lee, reached
the camp before Boston, in order to animate them in the general
pursuit of continental independence.</p>

<p>Their military spirit had arrived at such a height, that the
younger branches of Quaker families at Philadelphia, waiving their
principles, associated themselves in arms.</p>

<p>Boston continued to be blockaded during the year, with but
little variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The rebels did not confine their hostile views to this object alone.
A number of partizan adventurers sprung up, whose rapid motions
and unknown existence under Colonels Easton, and Ethan Allen,
were the means of achieving some conquests of much importance to
their infant cause. Their intermediate object was to seize upon the
passes on the great lakes, which command the intercourse between
Canada and the British Colonies, until their Government, (for so I
now call it,) was enabled to advance a force sufficiently adequate to
conquer that Province. This they effected by surprizing the
garrisons of Ticonderoga and Crown Point.</p>

<p>The American Congress, with the notes of conciliation and peace
ever sounding within the walls of their House, had taken early pains
to interest the Canadians in the destinies of their neighbours, by
inflammatory addresses, and by artful and apposite inferences drawn
from the immortal writings of Montesquieu, their Countryman, suited
to their prejudices and their political feelings. Having thus placed
the train to a deep design, those wily Continentals trusted to time in
accomplishing its intended effects.</p>

<p>America soon availed herself of that enthusiasm which pervaded
her Citizens, to turn it to a purpose. Already had she disseminated
her doctrines over Canada, which she was determined to follow up
with her arms. Generals Montgomery and Schuyler headed the
troops which were destined to invade that Colony, who found
many of the natives either wavering or friendly to the infatuating
name of Liberty. After a series of successes in the capture of Forts
Chamblee and St. John's, the defeat of General Carleton, at Longueil,
and the surrender of Montreal, all in the Upper Province, the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
hope that remained of preserving Canada for the British Crown,
centered in the town of Quebec.</p>

<p>Within the defenceless walls of Montreal, was that brave and
valuable Officer, General Carleton, now Lord Dorchester. Feeling
the weight of his duties, and also conscious of his own importance,
at so perilous a crisis, he resolved upon escaping from its impending
surrender, which would have deprived his Country of his services.
The impulse was patriotically great, and the event was happy.
Committing himself, in the night, to a boat, with muffled paddles,
he escaped the vigilance of the rebel guards, and reached the seat of
his Government. Here he arrived in the hour of danger.</p>

<p>A co-operating expedition, under Mr. Arnold, against the
Lower Province of Canada, unequalled in military annals, for the
originality of plan, and boldness of execution, had threatened the
Capital, in the absence of its Governor. Without a distinct object
of reference, it would be useless attempting to delineate the
progressive advances of these daring invaders, from New England.</p>

<p>It is enough to say, that a body of Soldiers, ultimately formidable,
with their arms and other necessaries, traversed a path, in many places
hitherto untrodden by human steps, of upwards 170 miles, interspersed
with thickets, precipices, and swamps, and often obliged to carry,
on their shoulders, the numerous batteaux attached to their little
Army. Such were their sufferings, that many returned, but those,
whom constancy supported in following their Chief up to the
walls of Quebec, merit the highest encomiums which can be
rendered to man for undaunted perseverance and steady
fidelity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>We may often derive the most impressive examples from our
enemy, and they ought never to be rejected. A British Soldier only
needs the recital of any deed, in order to rival it.</p>

<p>Self interest obtained what patriotism and natural duty could
not stimulate in the souls of the inhabitants within the town of
Quebec. For some time, discord, and even disaffection were
prevalent, both of which fiendly passions were absorbed in the
venal virtue of defending their property, now threatened by the
approach of General Arnold and his magic troops. All united in
the cause of their King, and some Sailors and Marines, were landed
from the ships in the river, to second their energies. Feeling
himself unequal to a siege or a storm, Arnold fell back, and awaited
the cast of better fortune.</p>

<p>It was soon after this that General Carleton arrived, who quickly
adopted those measures which were worthy of himself and the
imperious emergency.</p>

<p>One company of the 7th regiment, might be termed the only
regular force under his command, his chief strength being in M'Lean's
newly raised corps of Scotch Emigrants, and the associated bodies of
English and French Volunteers.</p>

<p>To these a valuable addition was given of all the Marines
belonging to the ships of war, and upwards of 400 Seamen, who
had claims to a great share of merit for their steadiness and spirit
through the whole train of this defensive service.</p>

<p>The works had scarcely been repaired, in the best manner that
was possible, when General Montgomery, united to Arnold, having
subdued, with little difficulty, the other fortresses of Canada,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
appeared in the sanguine and immediate hope of consummating his
glory by also carrying its Capital.</p>

<p>His personal zeal, and the endurance of his troops during the
bitter frosts of winter, were only equalled by a similar vigour in their
comparative opponents.</p>

<p>Temporizing measures being but ill adapted for the season, or
the occasion, and little suited to the intrepid genius of Montgomery,
he followed its dictates, which were to rest the issue upon a general
assault.</p>

<p>It was the last day of the year 1775, and the last of his life, that
this brave man, ambitious of fame, and true to the interests he had
espoused, advanced against Quebec, in four divisions, to execute his
daring purpose; reserving to himself the chief post of honour and of
danger, which was directed against the Lower Town at Aunce de
Mere, while another, almost equally bold, was allotted to Arnold
and his hardy followers, which was aimed at another part named
"the Saut au Matelot." The two others were devoted to puzzle
the garrison by false attempts upon their very extensive lines, and
to succour where necessary.</p>

<p>Under cover of a snow storm, the whole moved towards the
towns. The British were alarmed, and at their stations. Montgomery
had to encounter many natural difficulties, but success for a while
attended him. Having gained the first barrier, he pushed on to the
second, from which issued forth a tremendous fire of grape shot and
musquetry, which closed his days, and the hopes of his detachment;
who, strange to say, under the conduct of <i>A Campbell</i>, retreated
without making one effort to avenge his fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Soldiers who have been conspicuous for discipline, will most
assuredly be ever distinguished by courage when it is called forth.
Those faithful fellows who had accompanied Arnold through the
desert, without a murmur, followed him to battle and through all
its reverses with an unsurpassed bravery.</p>

<p>They, too, were early deprived of their leader, by a shot which
shattered his leg; when he was carried from the field.</p>

<p>But this did not appal them. The garrison, now freed from their
distracted duties, levelled their united force against this impetuous
detachment, who had advanced too far to retreat with safety, and
which became endangered by accumulating difficulties on every side.
Their dilemma did not escape the keen eye of the Governor, who
pushed a considerable force in their rear. Upwards of three hours
did they withstand the unequal combat, when they were at last
compelled to surrender prisoners of war.</p>

<p>That tribute which justice stretches forth to an enemy must
reflect its rays upon those who have had the honor to contend with
them. I cannot superadd a higher testimony to the British General
and his Garrison, than by thus appreciating the foe whom they
had to encounter. It yields me a proud retrospect that the corps
of Marines had their proportion of desert in defending Quebec,
and by it, maintaining this remnant of America to our Empire.</p>

<p>United by the feelings of sympathy, I would remark the spirit of
Mr. Vivion, then Purser, I believe, of a small sloop, and now of his
Majesty's ship Robust, who most patriotically stepped into the ranks,
and served as a private during the whole siege. He too produced
a son who yielded not to his father in honourable deeds, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
subsequent fall in the cause of his country and in bravely advancing
the glory of his corps, was sensibly deplored by my brethren, and
by me.</p>

<p>General Carleton sealed and ennobled his gallant defence, by
acts of humanity and mercy to the vanquished. A cool prudence
in not hazarding his acquired success to the contingencies of fortune,
enabled him to preserve the fruits of it for the solid interests of his
King.</p>

<p>The besiegers retired, but he did not follow them; after which, all
their attention was devoted to the interception of supplies for Quebec.</p>

<p>Arnold, who now succeeded to the command of the rebels,
evinced that resolute mind and ready expediency by which his
conduct had been hitherto marked.</p>

<p>During the course of this year may be noticed the active duties
of some small parties of Marines, in supporting the legal authority
of Lord Dunmore in the Province of Virginia, which had not yet
disavowed its allegiance. The spirit of rebellion beginning to
shew itself, the Governor, after having sent off his family, entrusted
his personal safety to the detachment from his Majesty's sloop
Fowey, who fortified his house at Williamsburgh, planted artillery,
and from which he issued all his proclamations, and, as long as
was prudent, continued to exercise in it, his official functions. It
was at last judged proper, under this escort of Marines, to proceed
on board the Fowey, from whence his Lordship still corresponded
with the Province.</p>

<p>The political discussions that ensued, are foreign to my review.
His Lordship's military exertions to reclaim or to conquer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
disaffected, were fatal in their issue, from being impotent in the
means. By the combined attack, however, of a few ships of war,
and two parties of Sailors and Marines which were disembarked,
the town of Norfolk, first in rank for commercial wealth, was
set on fire and reduced to ashes, upon the New Year's Day
of 1776.</p>

<p>Many other hostile measures against the sea coasts of America,
and her different interior Provinces, spread widely the calamities
of war and the mutual desire of retaliation.</p>

<p>Amongst the augmentation to his Majesty's forces, 6665 Marines
were voted for the year 1776; being an additional number of 2378.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he sufferings of the troops in cantonments at Boston were
uncommonly great, from the want of fuel and other supplies, while
these of the regiments and Marines upon Bunker's Hill, exposed
in tents to all the storms of winter, and necessarily for ever on the
alert, in the vicinity of a superior enemy, were proportionally still
more severe. Military enterprize, however, fell asleep on both
sides, and it did not awaken but with the return of spring. A
dread of famine floating in the minds of many, superadded to their
temporary evils.</p>

<p>During these existing hardships, a detachment of Marines,
under the escort of an armed ship, was sent to Savannah, in Georgia,
with a view to procure provisions, either by purchase or by force.</p>

<p>The Militia assembled to oppose their landing, and after some
unpleasant discussions, erected batteries along the shores of the
river so named. Proceeding to extremities, a short contest ensued,
which terminated in burning seven vessels deeply laden, and the
loss of a few lives; after which the party returned to Boston.</p>

<p>A few arrivals from Europe tended to alleviate the wants of the
garrison, who often beheld the humiliating sight of the triumphs
of little rebel privateers, in capturing their most important aids,
without our ships of war having in their power either to retaliate
or to prevent them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Some Parliamentary decrees, which left but little hope of the
renewal of friendship, having reached America, its Congress strongly
urged General Washington to push the siege of Boston with vigour,
in order that their forces might be enabled to oppose those dangers,
which they anticipated in other quarters of the Continent. Accordingly
a cannonade and bombardment began from Phipp's Farm on
the evening of the 2d of March, that continued during some
successive nights, and, on the morning of the 5th, another battery
from the heights of Dorchester Point, on the other side of the town,
which had been constructed with unexampled secrecy and dispatch,
also opened. These fired some houses, and occasioned other losses.</p>

<p>General Howe felt indignant in being thus cooped up.</p>

<p>His communication with the other part of his Army, at Boston
Neck, becoming endangered, and foreseeing that the rebels would
still extend their works to those heights which command the town
and harbour, he resolved upon dislodging them from such as they
held.</p>

<p>Hazardous was the attempt, and it was only prevented by an
intervening storm on the night of the 5th of March, when the
troops destined for the attack were on the eve of embarkation.
All who know how to appreciate the military character of that
gallant officer, will readily sympathize with him in his feelings
upon so degrading an occasion, when his high talents could avail
nothing, and the energies of as fine a body as ever entered the
field were stayed by the hand of prudence. Thus situated, he
lamented in common with the meanest Soldier, a total suspension
of their services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>An instant alternative of engaging a very superior Army strongly
entrenched, or evacuating the place, became hourly more and more
imperiously urgent. The former expedient held out but little hope
of surmounting their difficulties, in balance with many disastrous
consequences in the event of defeat; while the latter let loose an
inactive corps against a more vulnerable, or in co-operation with a
more loyal Province of America.</p>

<p>This the Commander in Chief adopted, but it teemed with
many obstacles and dangers, calculated to try the strongest soul.</p>

<p>He had not the safety of his Army alone to consider, in this
retreat, but the lives and property of numerous followers, whose
allegiance to their King no misfortunes could subdue.</p>

<p>The duty was sacred, and it was discharged with that humane
care which characterizes our nation, and him who performed it.</p>

<p>Upon the 17th of March the rear-guard of the British troops
embarked without molestation, when General Washington marched
in proud triumph into the town of Boston.</p>

<p>The Army reached Halifax, after some delays, early in April, but
it was now diminished, by hardships, to about 9000 effective men. The
battalions of Marines were landed, and did duty under the command of
Major Tupper<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, in garrison there, with much credit to themselves and
their corps. These testimonials, which were the honorable results of
their uniform good conduct, more usefully fall under a future detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>In the early part of 1776, General Arnold continued the blockade
of Quebec, under the greatest pressures, while its garrison, cut off
from every supply, and exposed to many bitter privations, was
equally conspicuous for a resolute firmness.</p>

<p>Some attempts to burn the British ships of war in the harbour,
in order to favour an escalade of the town during the existing
confusion, worthy of the inventive resources of Arnold, were made,
but they were counteracted by the vigilance and spirit of General
Carleton. Small Pox, dreaded, by the Americans, as the most
fatal plague, began to make its appearance, and dispirited their
troops. Discipline and good order were soon supplanted by
imaginary fears, and the precautionary cares of all to ward off
that contaminating evil. Murmurs succeeded, which, as must ever
be the case, paralyzed every noble effort.</p>

<p>By the indefatigible zeal and activity of that highly respected
name, Sir Charles Douglas, his Majesty's ship Isis, with two frigates,
having penetrated the ice, hove in sight, and reached Quebec on
the 5th of May. The situation of the enemy's investing force was
now critical. Having landed the few troops brought from Europe,
these ships also disembarked their Marines, with which, in addition
to those of the garrison, the General instantly advanced against the
American camp.</p>

<p>A very precipitate flight ensued, which ended in a trifling
carnage, taking some prisoners, and all the rebel artillery and
stores. Many of their sick and wounded took refuge in the woods,
or concealed themselves in the hamlets, towards whom General
Carleton extended, not only the generous tender of oblivion, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
protection. This benevolent act which proceeded from the instantaneous
impulse of his own breast, casts a bright lustre upon the military
virtues of that great man, and is alone sufficient to immortalize
his character.</p>

<p>Having been afterwards reinforced, a train of successful operation,
extraneous from my subject, soon took place, which expelled the
rebels from the Province.</p>

<p>Thus, a second time, were the partial efforts of the Marine corps
exerted most usefully upon Canadian ground.</p>

<p>A naval and military expedition, against the Southern Colonies,
having sailed from England, they did not reach the first object of
their instructions until the beginning of June. The squadron under
Sir Peter Parker, after passing the bar, moved against a newly raised
Fort on the South West point of Sullivan's island, which was
deemed the key to Charlestown, while the Army, under Sir Henry
Clinton, advancing against it by land, and crossing a supposed
shallow creek on the North Eastern extremity, was to make a
combined attack.</p>

<p>Upon the noon of the 28th of June the ships took their stations,
and commenced a furious cannonade, which was returned with
equal spirit and much effect from the fort.</p>

<p>Erroneous intelligence, as to the depth of water, it appears,
prevented General Clinton from approaching, as well as the very
formidable state of the provincial redoubts at the end of Sullivan's
island.</p>

<p>After one of the hottest conflicts that almost ever occurred, in
which the cool valour of British Seamen was eminently conspicuous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the squadron withdrew with the loss of a frigate, and upwards of 200
Seamen and Marines killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Captains Morris and Scott, of the Bristol and Experiment, were
both considered as mortally wounded, after extraordinary displays
of personal courage. Commodore Sir Peter Parker approved himself
a brave man upon this trying service.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1776, the Congress of America, unwilling
to attach to itself the responsibility of an arbitrary declaration of
independance, published a circular address to every Colony, in order
to ascertain their general sentiments, upon so eventful a topic.</p>

<p>The 4th of July must long stand as a memorable day on our
political epochs, as having been marked by their formal renunciation
of allegiance to the British Crown.</p>

<p>General Howe continued at Halifax upwards of two months
waiting farther reinforcements, which was but ill suited to his
disposition, or his military opinions. Wearied out, he at last put
to sea, under the escort of Lord Shuldham's fleet, and arrived
at Sandy-hook at the close of June. After gaining information of
the strength of New York and Long Islands, he judged it most
advisable to occupy Staten Island, where he landed without
opposition, and was soon joined by a number of loyalists.</p>

<p>It was a considerable time before the different reinforcements
from England reached Halifax, which immediately proceeded to join
the main Army, and enabled General Howe to undertake duties
more extensive in their aim, and more congenial to his wishes.</p>

<p>Upon that range of continental services which followed, I am
precluded from remark, as the battalions of my corps were restrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
from much active participation in them, by their having been allotted
for the defence of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>A Parliamentary Vote of 10,129 Marines passed in November,
which involved an augmentation of many companies to the
Establishment for the service of 1777.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">L</span>ord Howe, who had arrived in America during the last year
as Commander in Chief of his Majesty's Naval Forces, was united
with his brother in a civil, as well as a military commission. Exerting
the conciliatory influence of the former, they proclaimed to the
deluded, these tenders of forgiveness which emanated from their power.
The term "guilty," however, was not understood by the Americans,
who, from the era of general independance, qualified every individual
action as proceeding under the sanction of a Free Government. Of
course these well meant offers produced but little effect.</p>

<p>After many battles and skirmishes between the contending
parties, in which British valour was ever conspicuous, and the
resources of General Washington uniformly great, Long Island,
New York, and Rhode Island, were subjected to the Royal
dominion, and the Jerseys over run by our forces. They in turn,
however, met with reverses, which must always be expected in
war. To follow all those movements is not within my range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>General Howe having used every means of the most consummate
Officer to bring the enemy to a decisive battle, was as often eluded
by caution.</p>

<p>He accordingly aimed a blow at another quarter, and with this
view embarked a very powerful force, headed by himself. This
eventually proved against Philadelphia, which fell, after several conflicts
of the most brilliant kind, but particularly that of Brandy-wine.</p>

<p>Soon after, having gained that place, the rebels moved the
Delaware frigate of 32 guns, a number of gallies, gondolas, and
other armed vessels, to incommode the construction of the different
batteries that were carrying on for the protection of the town. That
ship anchored within 500 yards, but the tide falling she grounded,
when the British troops brought their field pieces against her, which
compelled her to strike. Captain, now General Averne, a gallant
Officer, and one of the worthiest of men, at the head of his
company, immediately took possession of her. The Grenadiers of
both the Marine Battalions had been incorporated with those of the
Army, previous to leaving Halifax, had hitherto been united in
their duties, and formed a part of that force, which, under Lord
Cornwallis, entered Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Lord Howe, upon learning these successes, judged it proper to
move his fleet and the transports, to concur in any future operations,
and to give the supplies of which the Army stood in need, by means
of the river Delaware. The progress of such a number of shipping
through so dangerous a navigation, was highly difficult, but it was
carried on under his Lordship's immediate auspices, and with
superior ability as well as skill. Owing to the numerous batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
constructed by the rebels, the passage to Philadelphia could not be
attempted, which obliged the whole fleet to anchor from Reedy
Island to Newcastle, along the Pennsylvania shore. Independent of
the most formidable works, they had sunk within the reach of their
guns, machines of the strongest kind, similar to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux de frize</i>, as
pointing in every direction, and those headed with iron. No attempt,
however, could be made to remove them, until their batteries were
gained on both shores of the river.</p>

<p>At the urgency of Captain, now Sir Andrew Snape Hammond,
who had reached the Delaware before Lord Howe, the Provincials
were driven from Billing's Fort, where they were raising works, and
preparing obstacles against the passage of the squadron. Captain
Hammond was peculiarly active in removing every hindrance, though
opposed by the enemy's Marine force.</p>

<p>As the supplies of the Army depended upon an intercourse with
the fleet, it became incumbent to carry Mud Fort Island, properly
so called, from its having been an accumulated mass of mud and
sand, a flat marshy spot, near to the junction of the river
Schuylkill.</p>

<p>It was necessary also to attack Red Bank, on the opposite shore
of New Jersey, where the enemy had constructed a very strong
redoubt, filled with heavy artillery.</p>

<p>In co-operation with a powerful fire against Mud Fort, from
some guns planted on the Western, or Pennsylvania side, an attack
upon it and the rebel craft was resolved on. For this service, the
Augusta, of 64 guns, and Merlin sloop were allotted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the navigation of the Channel being altered by the
sunken obstacles which every where presented in deep water, both
ran aground, as the bed of the river was also affected by them.
This did not restrain Captain Reynolds, now Lord Ducie, from
maintaining a heavy cannonade against the American works and
vessels, or from successfully combating the effects of some fire-ships
that approached for his destruction.</p>

<p>The Augusta, either from a red hot shot, or her own wadding,
was, after a warm contest, in flames, which suspended every hostile
effort, and turned the attention of most to their own preservation.</p>

<p>Amidst the awful conflagration, and an incessant discharge from
the rebels, Captain Reynolds retained his intrinsic coolness. After
each had consulted his own safety, and no hope remained of stifling
the flames, he continued alone, alternately took off his coat, waistcoat,
and stock, placed them on the gangway, and committed himself
to the deep. Heaven interposed at this perilous moment, and
preserved a life, which was subsequently marked by the most gallant
deeds, and is still prolonged to justify the goodness of Providence,
by the display of every virtue that can adorn human nature. Captain,
at present Major General Barclay, of Marines, was a companion in
this trying scene, and was much distinguished for his steady conduct.
The Merlin was also destroyed.</p>

<p>This fatal attempt by sea, was alike disastrous on the part of the
Army. A well-concerted and bold attack upon Red Bank, by a
large Corps of Hessians, terminated in repulse and a heavy loss.
Unfortunate as was the issue of both, still each department well
merited a sprig of the laurel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>From the importance of the object, the views of our Commanders
were renewed against these strong posts. The exertions of the
Officers and Seamen of the Fleet were great, and toilsome in transporting
cannon and stores to a small morassy spot, named Province
Island, which would effectually disturb the enemy. Having opened
fire from it, and a fair breeze springing up, a well-digested plan of
naval attack was carried into effect.</p>

<p>Proceeding by different channels, the ships were brought against
various points of Mud Fort, and other branches of defence, upon the
15th of November, when, after a long destructive cannonade, the
rebels deserted it in the night. Captain Cornwallis, in the Isis,
shewed much judgment and spirit upon this occasion.</p>

<p>A detachment from the Army having been also directed against
Red Bank, the Americans hastily withdrew, after partly destroying
the works, but leaving their artillery and stores. They also set fire
to many of their vessels on the river.</p>

<p>Thus was a way, in some degree, opened for supplies to the
troops in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>General Washington, who had followed the Royal Army,
remained in its vicinity, but constantly resisted every effort in
bringing him to a general action.</p>

<p>The unhappy issue of the expedition under Lieutenant General
Burgoyne, previous to this era, threw a general damp, and accelerated
the decision of France in entering the list against us. By apparent
and occasional concessions, that insidious Power observed a temporizing
system, until she had attained the means of following up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
her hostile views. So suspicious were her designs, however, that
considerable armaments continued to be carried on in our ports.</p>

<p>During this period of national despondency, the towns of Liverpool
and Manchester nobly stepped forth in aid of their Country.
Each tendered 1000 men, which was accepted, and their patriotic
example was diffused throughout the land.</p>

<p>Involved in a civil contest, the natural energies of Britain were
paralyzed by the floating hopes of reconciliation, and an enfeebling
compassion towards her American fellow-subjects.</p>

<p>An unhappy faction continued also to oppose our ill-guided
councils, at this awful crisis, from which the rebels derived a fatal,
but animating spirit. No true Englishman can throw an eye upon
the transactions of that momentous era, without the most poignant
reflections for his suffering country.</p>

<p>Long may the sad precedent, and its baneful results, be stamped
on every heart! May the imperious obligations of fidelity to our
King, and general union amidst public danger, be coeval with the
age at which every Briton is taught his duties to his God!</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>leven thousand Marines constituted the establishment of
1778.</p>

<p>Until the close of the last year France stood in awe, and continued
to cherish the flames of rebellion by assurances only of
support. Remarking the humbled spirit of our nation, at all times
too prone to over-rate its calamities, that Power became less
cautious, and in a little time avowed her inimical purposes. This
was accelerated by a meditated plan of reconciliation, which had
undergone the sanction of Parliament, and was about being submitted
to the American revolters.</p>

<p>To circumvent its effects, our natural enemy closed with these
States a treaty of commerce and defensive alliance upon the 6th of
February, which inspired them with a well-timed hope of rising
superior to all their pressures. Never did Mercy appear in such
odious colours, as when she went forth to the Colonists. Her good
offices were every where rejected with contempt and disdain, of
which the American Congress gave a conspicuous example. The
British Army too, could not recognize Her, and doubted much
whether She was of true English origin.</p>

<p>Winter had suspended every active essay on the part of both
armies, excepting in the case of some detachments that were from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
necessity pushed into the country for supplying our numerous forces
in Philadelphia; to afford a protection to the suffering Loyalists, and
to annihilate the ships and vessels of the rebels, which still remained
higher up the Delaware river.</p>

<p>One of these was entrusted to the Hon. Major Maitland, who
had long served with distinguished credit in the Corps of Marines,
whose high military talents had recently paved the way for his
transit into the line, and which placed him, at this time, at the
head of a Battalion of Light Infantry.</p>

<p>In conjunction with Captain Henry, of the Royal Navy, who
commanded a force of three gallies and other armed small craft, the
Major embarked in some flat-bottomed boats, with the 2d Battalion
of Light troops, upon the 7th of May. Agreeably to his instructions,
he proceeded to destroy the rebel Marine between Philadelphia and
Trenton.</p>

<p>At ten on the noon of the 8th, he landed at White-hill, where
a superior force of the enemy, chiefly Cavalry, seemed determined
to oppose his progress. After having got ashore some field-pieces,
Major Maitland pushed on towards Bordentown with great alacrity,
driving before him the rebels, and surmounting, with much spirit,
many local obstacles. Here he took five guns that commanded the
river, and burnt a large quantity of provisions, tobacco, military
stores, and camp equipage.</p>

<p>The enemy began to collect in great numbers at Trenton, where
they looked for this flying detachment; but its leader, after
indulging them in this idea, suddenly struck off towards the river,
re-embarked, and took post on the Pennsylvania shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 9th, he advanced to Biles-island
Creek, burnt some valuable vessels, moved on to Bristol, thirteen
miles distant, in the afternoon destroyed every ship there, and
returned, with his active followers, on board the boats at sun-set.
Never was the distinguishing motto of "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hilariter et celeriter</i>," more
truly exemplified than throughout these rapid duties. The manner
in which this service was performed, was highly characteristic of
the genius of that man who so completely achieved it.</p>

<p>The rebel loss amounted to 2 frigates, 9 large ships, 6 privateers,
23 brigs, and many schooners; besides an immensity of goods and
stores.</p>

<p>The Navy very justly were entitled to their share in these
honourable transactions.</p>

<p>General Howe soon after resigned his command to Sir Henry
Clinton, whose first measure was the evacuation of Philadelphia,
upon the morning of the 18th of June. In this retreat they were
materially aided by the ships of war, as the whole Army, by the
admirable dispositions of Lord Howe, were conveyed and encamped
on the Jersey shore before ten at noon. Their retrograde progress to
New York, with its attending incidents, are events unconnected
with my purpose.</p>

<p>The preparations of France had preceded her hostile avowals.</p>

<p>Count D'Estaing, putting to sea from Toulon in April, made the
Virginia coast early in the month of July. His hopes were to have
found the British Fleet and Army, in the Delaware, and at Philadelphia,
and by an united attack with General Washington on both,
to have struck a blow at once decisive of the fate of America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Disappointed in these, he proceeded off New York, and after a
few menaces he again disappeared, at first shaping his course to the
Southward. But this was merely to cover his design against Rhode
Island, in concert with a rebel force under General Sullivan. The
French Admiral entered that harbour upon the 8th of August,
anchoring his fleet between Newport and Conanicut.</p>

<p>Advice having been sent to Lord Howe, at New York, of the
enemy's motions, his Lordship hastened to relieve the Garrison, and
arrived in sight of it on the morning of the 9th.</p>

<p>D'Estaing, seizing a favourable wind, pushed out again, and
formed in line, with the evident resolution of hazarding a battle.
After two days of able manÅuvring on the part of Lord Howe to
gain the wind, which was thwarted by adverse circumstances, he
quietly awaited the enemy's attack. Just on the eve of conflict,
Neptune interposed, and scattered the hostile fleets.</p>

<p>This produced some single actions, in which English valour
uniformly triumphed against powerful superiority, but was rendered
unavailing in every instance, by the contingencies of fortune. The
gallantry of Dawson, Hotham, and Raynor will appear indelible
upon our Naval annals, as well as the bravery of those Seamen and
Marines who so nobly seconded them.</p>

<p>The French Fleet, after recovering from the storm, again peeped
into Rhode Island, from whence the rebels had retreated in confusion.
It gladly took refuge in Boston, whither Lord Howe followed
it, but durst not attempt so strong a position.</p>

<p>Thus D'Estaing gained but little from his system of surprize.
He was a fit agent to have executed the insidious schemes of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Court, when we recollect his breach of parole in the East, which
would have made him the sanctioned victim to a halter, if he had
fallen within our power.</p>

<p>The appearance of a new and natural foe seemed to revive in
every breast the flame of patriotism. At no period of our national
existence did the English character appear more great. The Commercial
Sailor vied with his Majesty's servants in the Fleet and
Army in this noble and emulous zeal.</p>

<p>Admiral Byron having sailed from England in the beginning of
June, reached the American coast with his fleet, but in a detached
and shattered state. An evil planet seemed to rule over all his
destinies, and his good fortune fell much short of his merit. Lord
Howe having resigned the Naval command to that Officer, he proceeded
off Boston, after having repaired all damages, from which he was
driven to Rhode Island by a heavy gale that proved fatal to some of
his ships. Of this D'Estaing took occasion to slip out, and with
a powerful force aimed his future efforts against our West India
islands.</p>

<p>Thither Commodore Hotham was detached with ten regiments,
under General Grant, who joined Admiral Barrington at Barbadoes
on the 10th of December, and on the 12th proceeded against St.
Lucia. Here the army landed, while the squadron anchored in the
Cul de Sac, where some Seamen and Marines were disembarked to
man the batteries on each side of the harbour.</p>

<p>D'Estaing, who had reached Martinique, sailed also to realize
his plans of conquest; but hearing of the descent upon St. Lucia, he
resolved upon relieving it. The attempt was fruitless, but it yielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the display of much obstinate valour on both sides. The French
were completely beaten, and the island fell.</p>

<p>It would carry me beyond my purposed bounds to dwell upon
the many events of this year. The Marine Soldier was almost
entirely limited to Naval duties, which were, in a detached sense,
both numerous and brilliant upon the coasts of America.</p>

<p>In the indecisive battle of the 27th of July, between the grand
Fleets of Britain and France, Lieutenant John M'Donald, of Marines,
on board the Prince George, was wounded.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">I</span>t is a tribute meritedly due to the Battalions of Marines who acted
so gallantly in the field, to take a retrospective view of their general
good conduct at Halifax, and the series of events connected with them.</p>

<p>As it has already been stated, they accompanied General Howe
from Boston to that place. The active exertions of the subordinate
ranks on board of the transports, not half manned, and encumbered
besides with the persons and property of the faithful Loyalists while
on the passage, were such, that a pecuniary recompence was given
to many of them, on their reaching Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival, both Corps were reviewed by that distinguished
Officer, Lord Percy, whose testimony, in consequence,
was couched in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lord Percy being well pleased with the appearance and
performance of the Marine Battalions yesterday (April 30, 1776),
desires his thanks to the Officers (in particular) and the men, for
their steadiness and attention in their several movements."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel (afterward General) Collins had assumed
the command of them soon after their reaching Halifax, and retained
it until his health obliged him to return to Europe, when it devolved
upon Major Souter, by orders from the Board of Admiralty. Both
Battalions were extremely solicitous to have united with the Army
under Sir William Howe, when on the eve of leaving Halifax for
more active services; but the defence of Nova Scotia being at that
period a very important object, it was partly entrusted to them, and
the Grenadier Companies alone were permitted the honour. On the
1st of June the notice of an additional indulgence to the Captains of
Marine Companies was published to both Corps.</p>

<p>"The Lords of the Admiralty are pleased to allow the Captains
of Marines the pay of an additional man per Company, which
will increase their present allowance to 1s. 6d. per day, for
paying their Companies, providing necessaries, repairing arms,
and burying their dead, in like manner as is practised in the
Army, and still on shore in North America. The Deputy
Paymaster will issue the same. The additional man per day
to commence from the time the Army in America was allowed
the same."</p>

<p>In order to inspire emulation, and to foster in the memories of
all the glorious 17th of June, Colonel Collins issued the following
Battalion-orders upon that day:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"In consequence of this day being the anniversary of the 17th
of June, when the <i>Marines</i> behaved in a brave gallant manner
at the attack of the rebel redoubt on the heights of Charlestown,
Colonel Collins extends pardon to all offenders to this day."</p>

<p>If the enemy had attempted Halifax, the line of battle directed
by Major General Massey was, "That Lieutenant Colonel Collins,
with the 1st Battalion of Marines, should draw up his right at
the house this side of Pedley's Hill. The Royal Highland
Emigrants, Royal Americans, Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteers,
and 2d Battalion of Marines, under Major Tupper, on the left;
the whole to form on the road. Lieutenant Gillespie, with the
field-pieces, in the centre; Captain Ramsay, with his detachment
of the 14th Regiment, to form on the grand parade, and
wait for orders from the Governor or General. The faithful well-tried
old Soldiers left here for garrison-duty, under command of
Lieutenant Needham, and the other Overseers of the works to
form on the Citadel Hill. Lieutenant Lindsay, with his troops,
to form at the Dutch Church, where General Massey will have
two mortars, with two howitzers fixed for his Corps; and he
makes not the least doubt of their readiness to assist in crushing
rebellion."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Collins having obtained leave to return to
England for his health, bid farewell to his Corps in these words,
upon the 16th of September:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Commanding Officer begs leave to assure the two Battalions
of Marines, that it is necessity, not inclination, which
forces him from hence. His highest ambition would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to have conducted them to England, when this distempered state
of America was settled. He begs leave to return the Officers
thanks for their constant attention, and flatters himself the
service will be carried on in the same uniform line it has hitherto
been, and if the change of climate permits the re-establishment of
his health, he will join them as soon after as possible."</p>

<p>As a just compliment to the discipline established by Lieutenant
Colonel Collins, Major Souter, who succeeded him, gave out these
orders, to both battalions of Marines, on the 18th of September.</p>

<p>"Major Souter desiring that the orders Lieut. Colonel Collins
has issued for the regulation and management of both battalions
be uniformly and invariably pursued; particularly those of an
Officer of a Company seeing that the men are properly dressed
and appointed, when ordered on duty, <i>before</i> they are brought
to the parade, and that no drunken men are allowed to fall into
the ranks at roll-calling. The Captains are likewise to keep
up the necessaries and appointments that have been ordered."</p>

<p>The gallant conduct of the Light Infantry Companies of Marines
on a preceding occasion, drew forth the encomium of Major General
Massey, upon the 19th of December, in these handsome words:</p>

<p>"His Honor the Lieutenant Governor having made application
to Major General Massey, that the two Light Infantry Companies
of Marines should continue at Fort Cumberland, the General has
consented to it, and takes this opportunity to inform their Brother
Soldiers that Major Bald, (who commanded there in a late
skirmish with the banditti rebels), in his report to Major General
Massey, tells him "that the two Light Companies run at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
rebels like lions, and behaved most bravely," which General
Massey communicates to the garrison with vast pleasure."</p>

<p>That gallant and good Officer, now Lord Clarina, ever ready
to attend to suppliant merit, and the Soldiers wants, in general
orders of the 24th of February, 1777, thus answers the Petition
of the 1st Battalion of Marines:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Major General Massey often receiving a petition from the
1st Battalion of Marines (signed Launcelot Poverty), is happy to
comply with their request, as their <i>uniform</i> good behaviour,
during the winter, well merits that indulgence. It is therefore
his orders, that Major Souter permits the men to work as he shall
judge proper, but that no substitutes must be allowed in their
public duty."</p>

<p>In the month of March, the Commander in Chief expecting some
actual service, was pleased to nominate Lieutenant (now Colonel)
Trollope, with a party of Marines, to be trained under Lieutenant
Gillespie, of the Royal Artillery, to practice quick firing and
traversing the great guns.</p>

<p>Early in April the two Battalions were consolidated into one,
by orders of the Board of Admiralty, addressed to Major Souter, to
the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High
Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Whereas the Earl of Sandwich has signified to us his Majesty's
pleasure, that the two Battalions of Marines, serving under your
command, shall be formed into one Battalion, each Company to consist of one
Captain, four Subalterns, five Serjeants, five Corporals, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
drummers, and 100 private men each, conformable <i>to the present
establishment</i> of the Corps, together with the following Field and
Staff Officers, viz. two Majors, one Adjutant, one Chaplain, one
Quarter Master, one Surgeon, and one Surgeon's Mate; you are
hereby required and directed to form the said two Battalions into
one Battalion accordingly, with the Field and Staff Officers as
before mentioned, and having so done, you are to cause the non-commissioned
Officers and private men which may remain after
this Battalion is formed, to be embarked in such of his Majesty's
ships serving in North America under the command of Vice
Admiral Viscount Howe, as may be in want of them, agreeable
to the requisition which will be made to you by his Lordship for
that purpose; but with respect to the commissioned Officers, over
and above the number necessary for completing the said Battalion,
you are to send them to England by the first opportunity that
offers, in order to join their respective Divisions, unless Lord Howe
shall apply to you, for any of them to serve in the ships of his
squadron, in which case you are to supply them accordingly.</p>

<p>An order, upon the 29th of April, to the Marine Battalion,
extended the allowances of six contingent men to Captains of
Companies, until the pleasure of the Admiralty Board was known.</p>

<p>In consequence of a review of the Battalion by the Commander
in Chief at Halifax, the following after-orders were given out on
the 9th of June:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Major General Massey approves so very highly of the steadiness
as well as the appearance of the Corps of Marines which
he had the honour to review this day, that he returns Major
Souter, the Officers, and Soldiers, his most grateful thanks for
their performance in the field."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Trollope, of Marines, was appointed to the duty of
attending the Commander in Chief; and Lieut. Waller as Brigade
Major to the Provincial forces, during 1777.</p>

<p>In December of that year, Lieutenant John Oldfield, who had
lately received a Marine commission, after having served with much
credit as a Volunteer, was directed by General Massey to accompany
Colonel Goreham to Fort Cumberland, in these handsome terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Oldfield, of the Battalion of Marines, is to return
with Lieut. Colonel Goreham to join the Light Infantry of that
Corps, Lieut. Oldfield having acquired so thorough a knowledge
of that country, which the General hopes will recommend him to
farther notice and future promotion."</p>

<p>His Majesty's ship Milford having run on shore, was nearly lost
in the beginning of December. Such were the exertions of the
Marines upon the occasion, that Sir William Burnaby, her Commander,
felt it his incumbent duty to tender them his thanks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
these words&mdash;"Sir William Burnaby desires his thanks may be
given to the Officers and men of the Battalion, who so actively
assisted in getting off his Majesty's ship Milford." This was
read to the Companies at evening roll-calling.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Trollope having been appointed Secretary to Major
General Massey, Lieut. Tantum, a respectable young Officer (who
was afterwards unfortunately drowned in the Ville de Paris), was
attached as an assistant Artillery Officer in his stead; a party of
Marines was trained to the great guns, and the command of the
Half-moon Battery, as well as of the Citadel, was allotted him under
the event of an alarm.</p>

<p>Although neither the circumstances of the action, or name of the
achiever, are alluded to in the following detail, still it carries in
it that zealous anxiety to promote discipline, by recompencing merit,
that I cannot omit its insertion.</p>

<p class="pad2">"General Orders, Halifax, February 27, 1778.</p>

<p>"That good Marine Soldier who was yesterday with General
Massey, and who now forgets his name and Company, the
General wishes to see to-morrow morning at nine o'clock, as he
wants to reward him for his loyalty. General Massey will be
much obliged to Major Souter to order this to be read by an Officer,
at roll-calling, to the different Companies."</p>

<p>In April, Lieutenant Jacobs who was an ornament to his Corps,
(subsequently drowned at St. Lucia) was appointed to act as Overseer
to the King's Works, which were carrying on.</p>

<p>No occasion seemed to have been lost by General Massey in
calling forth talents wherever they were to be found, and applying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
them to the public good. Such precedents, if generally adopted
upon service, would stimulate the Marine Officer to the early study
of every branch of military education. It is but rarely that we are
inclined to devote our attention to sciences which may never be
called into action, and what our professional views seem almost to
render unnecessary. This knowledge may adorn the man, but it
is too often restrained from being useful to our Country.</p>

<p>Upon the 25th of August the Marine Battalion was struck off the
roster of duty in the garrison of Halifax, previous to its embarkation
for Europe.</p>

<p>Major General Massey delivered, in Public Orders of the 30th,
his testimony of the general conduct of both Officers and men to
this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Commander in Chief cannot part with the Marine Corps,
without telling them he was pleased with their soldier-like
appearance at the review of yesterday, and now has the pleasing
satisfaction to say, that he has had the honour to command that
Corps for above two years, <i>without ever hearing of a Court Martial
in it, or ever rebuking an Officer or Soldier</i>.</p>

<p>"He will therefore make such a report of that respectable body
of men as they merit, and now wishes Officers and Soldiers
plenty of prize-money, and makes not a doubt but they will
always contribute to the glory of his Majesty, King George's arms."</p>

<p>On the 1st day of September the whole embarked, but in
consequence of a petition from the Lieutenant Governor and Council
of the Province of Nova Scotia, intreating their continuance, in
order to yield their tribute of respect, the Commander in Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was pleased to intimate the following notice, in Public Orders of
the 7th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lieutenant Governor and Council, having made application
to Major General Massey, praying the Marine Corps may be
detained here, and Lord Viscount Howe having left the determination
to him, the Major General is happy to comply with the
Lieutenant Governor's request; they, therefore, are to continue in
the harbour till further orders, and Major Souter will please to
land the men on board the transports, at either Dartmouth or the
Eastern Battery, in order to give them an airing, at such times as
he may choose to order."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the result of this liberal indulgence produced
a constant intercourse between the town and transports during
their stay, still the same harmony reigned during their social hours;
and to the eternal honour of the meanest Marine Soldier, neither the
merchant, the fatherless, the widow, or the orphan, could cast an
eye after him for an unliquidated shilling. Such conduct necessarily
drew the grateful sentiments of the Constituted Powers, which were
expressed to Major Souter by a letter from Mr. Bulkeley, of which
the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap ">Halifax</span>, Sept. 10, 1778.</p>

<p class="pad2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have singular pleasure in obeying the request of the
Members of his Majesty's Council, by conveying to you, and
the rest of the Officers, our acknowledgments and thanks for
the good order and discipline observed by the Battalion of
Marines under your command, during the whole time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
have been on duty in this town. I have the honour to
be, Sir,</p>

<p class="right padr2">"Your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Richard Bulkeley.</span>"</p>

<p class="noindent xs">Major Souter.</p>

<p>Those steady Soldiers soon after sailed for England, and they
continued to preserve the same conduct through all their subsequent
destinies.</p>

<p>I have thus placed this train of honourable retrospect under one
connected view. To have interspersed the incidents amongst the
successive and fleeting periods in which they occurred, and what
have been already discussed, would have been uninteresting and
less impressive. I have peculiarly addressed myself to my Corps
throughout this domestic narrative; and while I have exhibited a
bright pattern of valour, combined with steady discipline, in the
Marine Battalions that were employed upon the soil of America, I
am sanguine to hope, that after having viewed the picture, <i>not one</i>
amongst our numerous ranks will ever deface its beauties.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXXIII" id="CHAP_XXXIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he public emergencies called for a very considerable addition
to the Corps of Marines in 1779. Seventeen thousand three hundred
and eighty-nine were voted, being an effective augmentation of
5560.</p>

<p>Early in the year accounts were received of the capture of
Pondicherry, by the united efforts of the Navy under Sir Edward
Vernon, and a large force of European and Company's troops under
Sir Hector Monro. After more than two months of very fatiguing
duties, owing to the heavy rains, the siege was brought to that issue,
which invited a general assault.</p>

<p>The works having been much battered in every quarter of
approach, three different attacks were meditated; against L'Hospital
Bastion to the southward, the East face of the North West Bastion,
and from the sea to the northward.</p>

<p>These arrangements having been made, nearly 200 Seamen,
and all the Marines of the squadron were landed on the 15th of
October 1778, in order to have joined in the storm, which was to
have taken place on the 17th. But Monsieur Bellecomb, who had
hitherto defended himself with much obstinacy, dreading this event,
proposed terms of surrender, which were accepted. Many were of
opinion, that had he withstood the onset, its result would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
been fatal to the British Army, from the extensive mines that he
might have sprung.</p>

<p>Admiral Byron, who arrived in the West Indies in the beginning
of 1779, rendered our Naval force in that country superior to the
enemy. He was foiled in every attempt to bring D'Estaing to an
action, who kept close in Martinique.</p>

<p>The English Admiral having gone to leeward, with a view
to collect the homeward-bound at St. Kitt's, and to escort them, a
small detachment of French troops took St. Vincent, after a very
inadequate resistance; and the conquest of Grenada soon after
followed, but under circumstances highly honourable to Lord
Macartney and our arms. At this, D'Estaing, who united in himself
the character of the Soldier and the Seaman, was present, and led a
French column in storming the British lines upon Hospital Hill.
These were carried, after a gallant defence, which led to the
immediate surrender of the Island.</p>

<p>Scarcely was this accomplished, when he was called to act upon
another element by the approach of Admiral Byron, who, deceived
by intelligence as to the French force, hastened down under a press
of sail and in a scattered order. A general ardour pervaded all to
close with the enemy, whose numbers could only be gradually
perceived as they stretched out from the land. They were at last
discovered to be far superior to the chacing fleet, when the advanced
ships of it, led by Admiral Barrington, nobly seconded by Captain,
now Lord Gardiner, in the Sultan, and Sawyer in the Boyne, had
begun the battle. To these names may be added Captains Collingwood,
Edwards, and Cornwallis, as having been highly distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
on the 6th of July. Lieut. Jonah Veale, of Marines, was killed in
this action, and Lieut. Richards wounded.</p>

<p>D'Estaing evinced a total want of Naval enterprize through the
day. He returned to Grenada during the following night, while
Admiral Byron proceeded to St. Kitt's to repair his damages.</p>

<p>The approach of the hurricane season determined the French
Admiral to take refuge, with his fleet, at Hispaniola, where he
received an urgent call to unite with the Armies of America in
recovering the Province of Georgia. Elated with his success at
Grenada, he anticipated to himself the glory, not only of driving
the British from this Colony, but of exterminating them from every
post which they occupied along the sea-coasts of that Continent.
There was not, to appearance, a force sufficient to stem his
ambitious views; but they were opposed and frustrated by a spirit
which often compensates the want of numbers.</p>

<p>D'Estaing's arrival on the coast of Georgia, early in September,
was marked with a partial success by capturing the Experiment, of
50 guns, after a gallant defence on the part of Sir James Wallace.
Unaccustomed to such an event as the capture of an English two-decker,
it was considered as a favourable omen, and swelled his
presumptuous hopes.</p>

<p>The appearance of such an armament struck wonder into General
Prevost and the Garrison of Savannah, which were intended as the
first victims to its power.</p>

<p>General Lincoln, with the Rebel Army from South Carolina,
hearing of their new allies, moved towards Georgia, to combine in
the attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>General Prevost issued orders to concentrate his detachments,
and began to add to his works. Captain Henry, of the Royal
Navy, commanded that force in the river Savannah with much zeal.</p>

<p>It became expedient, upon the nearer advance of the French
Fleet, to move the ships of war close to the town, to land the guns
and Seamen, and to incorporate their Marines with the Grenadiers
of the 60th Regiment.</p>

<p>After D'Estaing had debarked his army of 5000 men, he instantly
marched against Savannah, without waiting for Lincoln, and
desired the Garrison to surrender, on the 16th of September. General
Prevost solicited delay in answering his summons; in order to give
time for his outposts to join him.</p>

<p>During the critical interval of 24 hours, which were allowed,
that brave and active Officer, Lieut. Colonel Maitland, whom I
have formerly mentioned, reached Savannah with a force of 800
men, after having encountered obstacles and difficulties of the most
trying kind. Already, during the campaign of 1779, had he shewn
himself most consummate in all the requisites of a Soldier, by the
stand he made at John's Island with a handful of men, against ten
times his numbers, under General Lincoln. That deed alone was
enough to fix his military fame, which acquired additional glory by
his <i>wading march</i> from Beaufort, to the relief of Prevost. In this,
few men could have equalled, and none surpassed his undaunted
fortitude and steady perseverance. It was the means of saving
Georgia and its Capital.</p>

<p>Such were his personal fatigues and anxieties to reach the scene
of his future duties, that both struck at the vitals of his existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
which afterwards closed a life long valuable to mankind by habitual
exercises of the most amiable benevolence, and happy to himself
by the approving consciousness of its having never been stained by
dishonour. The activity of his spirit, however, buoyed him up
under every bodily suffering, while Savannah was besieged by the
enemy.</p>

<p>My limits will not allow me the extent of detail, which was
very creditable to the courage and exertions of all.</p>

<p>Count D'Estaing, little looking for such protracted operations,
and growing impatient under them, determined to storm early on
the morning of the 9th of October.</p>

<p>Two feigned attacks by the American Militia, were planned
against the Garrison, to attract its attention to the centre and left,
and it was also resolved that, whilst D'Estaing and Lincoln moved
against Spring-hill redoubt in front, Count Dillon, with another
column, should advance along the edge of a swamp which communicates
with the river above the town, silently pass the redoubts
and batteries, and thus gain the rear of the British lines. This
column losing its way, was embarrassed in the morasses, and after
the dawn was exposed to a heavy fire, that threw it into a disorder
from which it could not recover.</p>

<p>D'Estaing, under the cover of darkness, got near the redoubt
just as the day began to break; but he was received with incessant
volleys and heavy discharges, which committed a dreadful carnage.
This part of defence was entrusted to Captain Tawse and his little
Corps of Provincial Dragoons, who maintained it with enthusiastic
bravery. Alternately had the French and American standard been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
planted on the parapet, when that gallant Chief, defending in person
the gate of his redoubt, and his sword still unentangled from the
body of an impetuous Frenchman, received his own death-wound.
Here there still continued a doubtful contest for possession, when
Lieut. Colonel Maitland, commanding the force upon the right of
our lines, pushed on the 60th Regiment and the Marines, who, with
charged bayonets, soon decided the struggle. The assailants were
driven from the ditch, and retreated quickly, with the loss of 901
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty the British could be restrained from
following their superior forces, whose future operations were limited
to the re-embarkation of their troops and stores, and the retreat of
the Rebel Army into South Carolina.</p>

<p>The Count D'Estaing, with a part of his fleet, returned to
France, after having achieved nothing worthy of notice, and his
other ships proceeded for the West Indies.</p>

<p>Throughout this service the Navy were justly entitled to a great
share of merit. Never were the exertions of the Sailors at the great
guns more animated or useful.</p>

<p>Captain, afterwards Colonel Moncrieffe, of the Engineers, exhibited
symptoms of the highest talents in his profession; and a share
of honour truly falls to the lot of Captain Charlton, of the Corps of
Royal Artillery, which has been eminently and uniformly great
upon every service allotted them.</p>

<p>Lieut. Colonel Glazier, who led the Grenadiers and Marines
in the charge which decided the fate of every thing, attracted
much praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the raising of the siege, Lieut. Colonel Maitland
fell a sacrifice to his fatigues, which, producing a bilious fever,
deprived his Country of a faithful servant, and the Soldier of a true
friend.</p>

<p>Sir George Collier was most usefully active during the period of
his command in North America. He undertook nothing in which
he did not succeed, and in every instance of service exhibited a
prompt and decisive mind. The enemy's Commerce and Naval
Power suffered much by his spirited measures, in which I cannot
follow him.</p>

<p>In the month of June, Spain, after having received her treasures
in safety, entered the lists against Great Britain, whose situation now
seemed desperate to all the surrounding Powers. But the hour of
danger is the only occasion in which the native spirit of Englishmen
can best be known or appreciated. It called forth that union which
should ever constitute the pride, as it can alone secure the independence
of a nation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the immense superiority gained by this accession,
still the vigour of our combined enemies was by no means in an
adequate proportion. Their fleets soon after appeared on our coasts,
in numbers we were unable to oppose; but their exertions against
them were at first repressed by discord, and finally averted by
disease.</p>

<p>The only service upon which the Corps of Marines was employed
during the remainder of the present year, was in the capture of
Omoa, effected by parties from the Charon, Lowestoff, and Pomona
frigates, in conjunction with the Seamen of these ships, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
trained to small arms, and a number of baymen and logwood cutters
that were embodied at Truxillo. Commodore Luttrell conducted
the naval part of the expedition, and Captain Dalrymple the land
force. Disembarking at Porto Cavallo, they sustained great fatigue
in a night's march toward the fort, with a view to surprize it, on the
16th of October. Such were their obstacles from morasses filled by
the rains, and intervening precipices, that they found themselves
nearly six miles distant in the morning, and that they were discovered
by the enemy. After giving the men a little respite, Captain
Dalrymple pushed on, drove the Spaniards from an ambuscade,
secured and established posts on the heights round the town and fort,
and having been incommoded by musquetry from the place, he set
it in flames, at which time Commodore Luttrell entered the harbour
and completed the blockade by sea.</p>

<p>After cannon being landed, and the batteries opened during some
days, they had produced but little effect upon the enemy's works;
on which it was resolved to storm them with 150 Seamen and
Marines, united with some loyal Irish, who were to be aided in
their approach by a fire from the ships and the heights. Under this
cover the assailants advanced at four in the morning, against walls
28 feet in height. To these they applied their scaling ladders,
when the storming party, headed by two British Seamen, gained the
top, and being instantly seconded, the Spaniards, paralysed at the
daring act, begged for quarter.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the name and local origin of <i>one</i>
intrepid Sailor, upon this occasion, should have been lost. Ascending
with two cutlasses, he soon found an enemy almost asleep, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
he disdained to sacrifice: rousing him from his slumbers, he put one
into the Spaniard's hand, telling him they were now equal.
Whether from a dislike to the combat, or in gratitude for such
generous conduct, the tender, however, was not accepted.</p>

<p>The Commanders declined some offers of ransom made by the
enemy which would have been highly advantageous to themselves;
but they militated against their Country's interest. This conquest
was obtained with a very trifling loss.</p>

<p>Some valuable captures were brought into our ports during the
year, and our Commerce was well protected.</p>

<p>Sir James Wallace, by an exploit in Cancalle Bay, recalled to
the public mind the deeds of former times, by the capture or
destruction of three frigates under the French batteries.</p>

<p>Lieutenant A. J. Field, of the Marines, still lives an instance of
Providence, by an escape from the melancholy fate of too many of
his shipmates in the Quebec frigate, which blew up in action with
La Surveillante.</p>

<p>In this, British valour would have ultimately triumphed; but
it was obliged to yield to destiny. The most amiable manners, in
union with a cool courage, were the predominant features of Captain
Farmer's character.</p>

<p>Captain Pearson, of the Serapis, ennobled himself by a brave
defence against a much greater force, which assumes an historical
importance, from its happy consequences in saving a large and
valuable convoy entrusted to his care.</p>

<p>An action was fought between his Majesty's ship Pearl and
the Spanish frigate St. Ammonica, which very much signalized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Captain, now Admiral George Montague, and in which Lieutenant
Fowke, of Marines, was also distinguished.</p>

<p>Nothing of attached moment farther, appears within the review
of 1779.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXXIV" id="CHAP_XXXIV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">I</span>n every war it has been evident that state necessity has required
an annual increase to the establishment of Marines. Eighteen
thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine were the number decreed
for the service of 1780.</p>

<p>It was at this period, and has since been too prevalent a custom,
to embark recruits not only unscienced in discipline, but utterly
untrained to arms. Such deficiencies could only be compensated by
native valour, aided by the care of Officers in rendering them good
marksmen, and by that punctual system which prevails in our ships
of war. A few <i>regular-built Soldiers</i> should always be intermingled
with every detachment; a rule that can only be observed by maintaining
a sufficient strength during peace, or by a prompt levy on
the commencement of hostilities.</p>

<p>The year of 1780 was ushered in by some well-timed successes
of Admiral Rodney. While nature has so clearly pointed out our
means of defence, she has also taught our islanders to greet, with
tenfold joy, every victory that is gained upon their favourite element.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>After eighteen months of war against an inveterate foe, nothing
had been achieved worthy of being considered as a balance in the
scale; of course the taking of Langara in the PhÅnix, with three
other ships of the line, the explosion of the St. Domingo, and the
destruction of the St. Julian and St. Eugenio, of 70 guns, added
to the recent capture of one 64, escorting a valuable convoy, so
crouded together, filled the Country with general exultation.</p>

<p>Admiral Rodney exhibited much enterprize, although he possessed
superior numbers, by pursuing and vanquishing an enemy upon his
own coasts, during a most dreadful gale, and on a lee shore, which
had nearly proved fatal to many of his fleet, who, from their ardour,
became entangled amongst the dangerous shoals of St. Lucar.</p>

<p>Sir George Rodney was most ably seconded by the vigour and
counsel of his Captain, Young, whose talents as an Officer stood
meritedly high.</p>

<p>Although the Spaniards fought bravely, still they plainly shewed
that they were no adepts in the most essential branches of discipline;
as the blowing up of the St. Domingo, and a partial explosion in the
Princessa, proceeded entirely from a want of internal system.</p>

<p>Lieut. Strachan, of Marines, brother to the present Sir Richard,
was killed upon the forecastle of the Edgar in this action.</p>

<p>The immediate and happy effects of it were the relief of
Gibraltar and Minorca, besides convincing the coasts of the Mediterranean
that Britain was still able to assert her former dominion on
the seas. The Admiral prosecuted his course for the West Indies,
while the bulk of the Fleet returned to England under a continuance
of the same good fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Our enemies lost nine sail of the line upon the whole of this
expedition, which was suggested by necessity, but terminated with
the most signal consequences.</p>

<p>Accounts were received early in this year of the death of the
celebrated Captain Cooke, at the Island of O'why'he; in defending
whose valuable life, threatened by a horde of savages, four out of
nine of my Corps shared his destiny.</p>

<p>Long had our avaricious neighbours, the Dutch, continued to
foment the spirit of rebellion in the Western World, by various
supplies, without which its virulence, nay its existence must have
ceased. With one uniform character for punctuality in dealing, to
an extent and nicety rarely known but in our own land, these moral
virtues, which can alone give joy to the wealthy, are absorbed in
the Hollander by an unceasing pursuit of the same object. The
bonds of nature, and all the ties of honour which unite nation to
nation, are sacrificed by him to the call of self-interest. This
fiendly passion, and the repeated injuries sustained by England,
brought on a rupture between the two countries, friends by alliance,
but enemies in their principles of action.</p>

<p>The detention of Count Byland added fuel to the flame, by
furnishing means to the emissaries of France, in Holland, who were
active in working upon the popular mind. From the beginning
of 1780, the cause of these hostilities, which commenced towards
the close of the year, may be dated.</p>

<p>The conduct of the neutral Powers, at this crisis of accumulating
difficulties, was equally ungrateful. At the head of them was
Russia, whom we had nurtured in Naval tactics and the arts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
civilization, by a long train of friendly good offices. But her early
energies were levelled against the life of her Patroness, and in
defiance, too, of that maritime code of laws, which had been long
recognized by Europe as the fixed standard of commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>If ever there was a period of our existence that urged general
union it was this. Our Country seemed doomed to destruction, and,
like vultures hurried on by instinct to the spot of animal dissolution,
every nation crouded against our island to lay claim for its share of
our tottering Empire. To prevent the repetition of such a period
in our history, a fostering care of our Navy, and every branch
attached to it, appears the wisest system, and the most incumbent
duty.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton having been freed from every fear by the
glorious repulse of D'Estaing from Savannah, had it in his power to
carry the British arms to any part of the American coast. His first
essay was aimed against the province of South Carolina, and his
operations commenced on the 1st of April against Charleston, its
Capital, after having landed upon John's Island, and from thence
advancing by slow steps; which afforded time to the Rebels of
fortifying every point of defence.</p>

<p>Admiral Arbuthnot, with the squadron, soon after passed Fort
Moultrie with trifling loss, and anchored just without the range of
shot from the town, which completed its investment towards the
sea, though a communication was unavoidably open between the
Garrison and the Country, by means of Cooper's River to the North-east.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
This was soon cut off by a large detachment under Colonel
Webster, which General Clinton was enabled to spare, from his
access to the sea being kept up by the ships of war. A very brilliant
affair took place between the advanced guard of that force and a
body of Americans, at Monk's Corner, which reflected much honour
upon Colonel Tarleton and Major Fergusson, the former of whom,
soon after, very justly secured permanent fame, by beating a Rebel
Corps of Cavalry upon the banks of the Santee.</p>

<p>Early in May, the besiegers having completed their third parallel,
Captain Hudson, of the Navy, was landed with 200 Seamen and
Marines on Sullivan's Island, in order to have stormed the important
post of Fort Moultrie, at the same time the ships were to attack by
sea. The garrison surrendered to that party on the 6th of May.
This had a strong effect upon our subsequent operations, as the town
fell by capitulation on the 12th.</p>

<p>Very high commendations were bestowed upon Generals Earl
Cornwallis, Leslie, and Paterson; Lieut. Colonels Webster and
Tarleton, and Major Moncrieffe, also had their share of applause in
Sir Henry Clinton's detail. The services of Captain Elphinstone,
now Lord Keith, were also very signal. Much good was anticipated
from this happy event, which was not, however, eventually
realized.</p>

<p>The gallant exertions of Lord Cornwallis in the subsequent
progress of the campaign, upon a minute retrospect, must rank him
as a great and a zealous Officer. Colonel Tarleton also stands high
upon its annals, which will be recognized in terms of eulogium by
posterity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Admiral Rodney, who had proceeded to the West Indies from
Gibraltar, found himself opposed to a superior force of the enemy.
Confiding in the long-tried valour of a British Fleet, he was determined,
however, to dispute the palm with them. Monsieur Guichen,
previous to his arrival, had paraded before St. Lucia, seemingly
with a view of attempting something; but Rear-Admiral Hyde
Parker and General Vaughan had evidently made such judicious
dispositions, as deterred him from even a partial trial of force. Sir
George Rodney soon returned the visit, and offered battle, which
was not accepted. Leaving some coppered frigates to watch their
motions, he returned to Gros Islet Bay.</p>

<p>In the night of the 15th of April, De Guichen put to sea, and
was quickly followed, when a general chace ensued. At the close
of day on the 16th, the English formed into line, and a series of able
manÅuvring on both sides took place next morning. At eleven the
conflict began, which ended after four, when the enemy bore away.
The English Fleet, obliged to repair its damages, could not pursue.</p>

<p>Most tremendous was the fire of the Sandwich, Admiral Rodney's
ship, upon that day, and so visible were its effects, that it is impossible
to calculate what can be achieved by Britons, when their valour
is let loose, against any force, however great. Captain Carey, of
Marines, was wounded in the Grafton, and Lieut. Herriot, who
now so ably conducts a well-known paper entitled <i>The Sun</i>, in the
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Regaining sight of the French Fleet, they run for shelter under
the guns of Guadaloupe upon the 20th. The talents of Captain
Young, of the Sandwich, were peculiarly displayed upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
occasion, and were most auxiliary to the Commander in Chief.
Thus was the Empire of these Seas recovered by an inferior Fleet,
which was productive, however, only of a flimsy triumph, as there
were no English troops to follow it up by an attack upon their
islands. English commerce, however, was protected, while that of
the French suffered much. Two other actions of lesser note were
fought on the 15th and 19th of May, but equally indecisive.</p>

<p>The spirited countenance of Captain, now Admiral Cornwallis,
off Monte Christi, in the Lion, of 64 guns, having under him the
Bristol of 50, and Janus of 44, which were opposed by Monsieur
La Motte Picquet, reputed one of the best Officers in the French
Navy, with four 74 gun-ships and two frigates, must ever be noticed
as one of the most brilliant incidents of the American war.</p>

<p>It has been the lot of that brave man, to have saved to his
Country, in two instances, a respectable portion of her Naval forces,
when apparently doomed to fall and overwhelmed by numbers.
With his little squadron he resisted, successfully, this united attack,
through the night of the 20th of March, and on the following day
maintained the unequal combat nearly three hours. On the 22d
the English Ruby, of 64 guns, and two frigates appeared, with
which he, in turn, became the pursuer of La Motte Picquet, who,
by his own account, and in the true spirit of a Frenchman, asserted
his claim <i>to two hearts</i>, as being emblematical of his courage.</p>

<p>Some single actions were fought during 1780, that would have
done honour to any period of our maritime greatness.</p>

<p>Amongst these may be noticed the capture of La Capricieuse,
of 44 guns, by La Prudente frigate. Captain Waldegrave, now Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Radsdale. Speaking of the conduct of his Marines on this occasion,
he says, "In justice to Lieutenant Banks of the Marines, I must beg
leave to observe to their Lordships, that his party behaved with the
utmost steadiness and bravery, keeping up a regular and constant
fire from the beginning of the action, till necessity called them
to the great guns, when they shewed an equal share of spirit and
good order."</p>

<p>Another terminated in the taking of La Nymphe by the Flora,
Captain Peere Williams, which was manned principally by landsmen,
and a raw party of Marines. Soon after the conflict began, the
Flora's wheel was shot away, when both ships fell on board each
other. This afforded some instances of individual gallantry, by
repelling the enemy's boarders, and by the British returning the
compliment, and eventually striking the flag of La Nymphe.
Although complete adepts in the small sword, still it proved
unavailing against the cutlass and the axe.</p>

<p>Lieutenant, now Captain Busigny of Marines, very much
distinguished himself, and his sword bore marks of his valour.</p>

<p>Although not properly within my scope, still the bravery of
Captain Moore in the Fame privateer of Dublin, cannot pass
unnoticed. It reflected honour upon his Country. In his little ship
of 24 guns and 108 men, he attacked five sail of the enemy formed
into line, carrying 54 guns and 167 sailors. Four out of that number
were taken, and recompensed his courage by their wealth.</p>

<p>The alertness of a British Seaman, whose name cannot be retraced,
was the means of developing sufficient matter for reprisals against
the Dutch, upon the 20th of December. Never did there appear such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
a scene of low intrigue, and selfish cunning as in these papers which
were saved from the ocean. They betrayed a treaty of commerce,
which had existed, in secret, ever since 1778, with the rebel states,
which would have been soon cemented by one of alliance, under the
same dark cover, if this disaster had not discovered all, and brought
down the vengeance of Britain for such perfidy.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXXV" id="CHAP_XXXV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXXV.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>wenty thousand three hundred and seventeen Marines were
voted for the service of 1781.</p>

<p>The widely extended commerce of Holland now lay open to
general enterprize, which was soon successfully exerted. As avarice
was the predominant cause of hostilities, so it was the object of
chastisement.</p>

<p>Gibraltar attracted the early attention of our Ministry, by an
effort to relieve it, which was accomplished by Admiral Darby, with
the Grand Fleet, under circumstances of apparent difficulty, but of
eventual good fortune. If the Combined Forces had been united,
which was their annual policy and within their power, such an
attempt must have been abortive, or performed at an unwarrantable
risk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>That fortress persevered in a system of defence, peculiarly
destructive to the enemy, and of a kind the most honorable to
General Elliot and his garrison. Captain Hervey in the Panther,
with his small squadron, also gave proofs of wonderful courage, in
frustrating the aim of some fire vessels that were employed to burn it.</p>

<p>France always intent upon her own interests, embraced this
occasion of reinforcing her West India fleets by a powerful detachment
under the Compte De Grasse. This became necessary, from the
return of De Guichen to Europe, who, after having joined Don
Solano's fleet, went down to Hispaniola, with an evident purpose
of attacking Jamaica, but from whom he separated without a stroke.
Although the battles of Admiral Rodney afforded no signal marks
of victory in captures, still <i>their effects</i> had a strong influence in the
conduct of De Guichen for proceeding homewards with those shattered
ships, from amongst his fleet, that could be refitted only in Europe.</p>

<p>Holland soon felt the consequences of its baseness, by the loss
of all its West India possessions, and some valuable convoys. The
free port of St. Eustatius, hitherto the depot of America, and of every
adventurer who had money, fell early in February without firing a
gun. Demerara, Issequibo, and the Dutch Settlements on the
Spanish main were successively taken, together with the Mars of
60 guns, Admiral Krowl, with 28 sail of merchantmen under his
protection, who was killed by a musquet ball, in a short action with
the Monarch, Captain Reynolds.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel, now Lord Hood, having been soon after sent to
windward to cruize for De Grasse, was limited to a station, which
gave little hope of ultimate success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Three sail of the line were unfortunately retained at St. Eustatius,
which would have been a valuable addition to his force, thus inferior
to the expected arrivals from France.</p>

<p>The British Admiral continued off Fort Royal, Martinique, until
the 28th of April, when a signal was made for the enemy's approach.
Every effort was used to close with the land, and of course with them,
who, in line of battle, on the morning of the 29th, afforded protection
to a numerous convoy that soon reached a safe anchorage. De Grasse
was immediately strengthened by 4 ships of the line, from the Bay,
which authorized him to have followed up the most decisive views.
Sir Samuel Hood formed his fleet into close order, and was joined by
the Prince William of 64 guns, Captain Stair Douglas, who then
watered at St. Lucia, but had weighed with an unexampled dispatch
to share in the conflict, and who continued to cheer along the British
Line, until he fell into his station.</p>

<p>De Grasse opened his fire, but at a distance little calculated to
balance the scale of victory. He had the option of it though he never
availed himself of his fortune. Three hours cannonade was kept up,
during which it appeared that the French powder was much stronger
than ours, when the British Admiral seeing the unavailing expenditure
ceased to waste it.</p>

<p>This period could not boast of that liberal attention to the seaman's
wants, which has characterized our Country, during the late war,
towards her naval servants. Scurvy, at that time, was the prevalent
disease in our fleet, and this had reached an alarming height in
many of the ships attached to Sir Samuel Hood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The world too generally ground their opinions upon external
circumstances, without examining minutely into inferior details,
which, when known, will be considered, by the judicious, as often
constituting the solid merits of human action. To a great superiority
of fresh ships and healthy crews, as yet unbraced by the climate,
Admiral Hood was opposed with 7 sail less in number, reduced in
effective strength by scurvy, and against an enemy, whose naval
confidence had never arrived at a greater summit. That steady
countenance which he evinced in their presence, was yet surpassed
by a noble effort, on the following day, which shewed the invincible
spirit of his mind, and these resources so usually annexed to
magnanimity and talents.</p>

<p>Observing the scattered order of the French, and catching a
change of wind in his favor, not common in that Country, he directed
a general chace, and levelled all his force against their most
vulnerable point.</p>

<p>But the elements were fickle, and disappointed his manly views,
after which he bore up for Antigua to refit, and land his wounded.
The interval was seized by De BouillÃ© and De Grasse to carry St.
Lucia, who were happily resisted by the united energies of Captain
Campbell of the 87th Regiment, and Lieutenant, afterwards the
unfortunate but amiable Captain Miller of the Theseus. Improving
the same occasion, another, but more prosperous expedition, was
undertaken against Tobago, which was finally seconded by the
whole French fleet and army.</p>

<p>Sir George Rodney, having assumed the command, reached
Barbadoes on the 23d of May, where he learned the attack upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that island. Lieutenant Johnstone of Marines was sent in an Advice
Boat in order to gain intelligence, and other information of a secret
nature. His ability and zeal fully qualified him for the task, but
nothing could avert its surrender, after two fruitless attempts to
relieve it. This may be said to have ended the campaign of 1781,
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>In this summer the total reduction of West Florida was effected
by the Spaniards, who persevered in recovering the possessions,
formerly wrested from them. The combined fleets, after covering a
debarkation at Minorca, towards the close of August, proceeded in
triumph to the mouth of the British Channel, while Admiral Darby
retired to Torbay. Discord and sickness were again the agents of
heaven to counteract their menaces, and a kind Providence wafted
home our commerce in safety, soon after those powerful enemies had
each returned to his own ports.</p>

<p>The 5th of August exhibited a display of obstinate bravery not
unworthy of former times, when the Empire of the Seas was so
strenuously disputed by Great Britain and Holland. Two squadrons
headed by Officers, who were animated by the same stern spirit, met
on the Dogger Bank, each with a convoy under his protection.
Having secured their safety, Admiral Parker bore down against his
rival, Zoutman, who coolly awaited his approach until he reached
the good old measure for deciding their Country's differences and
prowess. After a close conflict of three hours and a half, the Dutch
resigned the palm by bearing up for the Texel. Captain Campbell of
Marines, in the Berwick, and Lieut. Stewart of the same ship,
besides Lieut. Cuthbert of the Dolphin, were the Officers that fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
under my review of casualties in wounded on that occasion. The
sinking of one of their 74's after the action, the safe return of a
valuable and important fleet into our ports, while that of the enemy
flew for shelter into their own, were the consequent fruits, and must
be undisputed evidences of victory.</p>

<p>During this unfortunate war, the similarity of language and of
manners, had introduced into the bosom of our Country many an
American Incendiary, who, without suspicion, were either the immediate
Emissaries or maintained a correspondence with those of France.
Inviolable secrecy must ever be the life of foreign expeditions, but it
unhappily did not exist at this era, and more particularly in that
which was set on foot against the Dutch Settlement at the Cape of
Good Hope.</p>

<p>This was undertaken under the joint auspices of Commodore
Johnstone and General Meadowes, who departed from England on
the 13th of March, and reached Port Praya Bay, in St. Jago, one of
the Cape de Verd islands, on the 10th of April.</p>

<p>During war there ought never be too confident a security.
Vigilance and alertness are the essence of discipline, and they never
should be relinquished even within the bosom of a friendly country.
A surprize can find no palliation.</p>

<p>Anchored in a scattered form, which a little time could not
entirely remedy, our squadron was unexpectedly assailed by Admiral
Suffrein, one of the few of his countrymen who met Englishmen on
their favourite plan of close fighting, and whom the early intelligence
of his court had detached with a force sufficient to counteract the
schemes of our Cabinet. After a most spirited attack which strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
attested his enterprize and courage, he was repulsed by British
valour, and his ships so much shattered as to hold out to the
Commodore the prospect of an ultimate triumph.</p>

<p>The enemy were afterwards chaced, but more imperious and future
views put an end to the pursuit. That good and gallant Officer Capt.
now Sir Thomas Pasley, of the Jupiter, Capt. Alms, of the Monmouth,
and Captain Hawker, of the Hero, were particularly noticed by
their Chief, for their conduct through the day. Great and animated
were the exertions of some of the East Indiamen, and the steady countenance
of Capt. Jenkinson and his detachment of the 98th Regiment,
in repelling the enemy's boarders from the Fortitude, attracted much
deserved praise. Suffrein having anticipated Commodore Johnstone,
in reaching the Cape, threw into the garrison every necessary supply,
which precluded all hopes of succeeding against it, and changed
the future plan of the expedition. Having received notice of five
Dutch East Indiamen being in Saldahna Bay, forty miles north from
the Cape, the squadron shaped its course thither, and made prizes of
four, the other having been set on fire. This was a deep cut upon
our avaricious foe. The French Admiral went on to India, and
General Meadows proceeded under a proper escort to the same quarter,
while the Commodore returned to England.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the diminished territories of France in the East,
still the zeal and ability of her Agents, well versed in intrigue, had
the address, not only to reconcile the existing contentions between
Hyder Ally and the Mahrattas, but to direct their united power
against our wide possessions in that part of the world. These were
to be supported by promised aids from Bourbon and the Mauritius, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
well as auxiliaries from many of the petty Princes of Hindostan, who
eagerly acceded to the coalition.</p>

<p>The apathy of the Presidency at Madras, at this momentous
crisis, was highly criminal. No steps were taken to concentrate
their troops, although they were long apprized of Hyder's views, who,
like a torrent, came down from the mountains and entered the
Carnatic with an army of 100,000 men. Sir Hector Monro, at last,
took the field against this host, and having raised the siege of Arcot,
fixed his post at Conjeverane, where he awaited his expected
reinforcements from the Tanjore Country in the South, and those
from the Guntaz Circar in the North.</p>

<p>This being merely introductory matter to future discussion, in
which my corps was called forth, my detail of these movements
must be concise.</p>

<p>The world well knows the sad disaster of Colonel Baillie's
detachment from the latter Country, in which was also involved that
of Colonel Fletcher from the Main Army, after having exhibited the
most extraordinary feats of European valour. From unaccountable
causes, no effort, worthy of the occasion, was made to alienate the
doom of those brave, but unfortunate men. The immediate consequences
were the retreat of General Monro to the Mount, and the
Carnatic being overrun by Hyder and his savage legions. Rapid
were his successes, and Madras itself anticipated the horrors of a siege
from this relentless invader.</p>

<p>The energies of the Council of Bengal were patriotically great
under these perilous events. Casting an eye towards that distinguished
Veteran, Sir Eyre Coote, he was with one general voice called forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to retrieve these calamities. He accordingly embarked from Calcutta,
with a force, while some seapoy battalions marched from Bengal to
the Carnatic. General Goddard was directed to transport a
detachment from his army acting against the Mahrattas, and Sir
Edward Hughes, with his fleet, was solicited to block up the ports
of Hyder, on the coast of Malabar. The Government of Bombay was
likewise ordered to alarm his dominions.</p>

<p>Sir Eyre Coote quickly restored its wonted lustre to the British
arms by a series of brilliant efforts, during 1781, that enabled him,
after the destruction of Hyder's naval force at Calicut and Mangalore,
by Sir Edward Hughes, to send an adequate detachment for the
reduction of Negapatam, which was committed to Sir Hector Monro,
who assumed the command of the troops in the Tanjore Country, and
who was enjoined to co-operate in the attempt with Admiral Hughes
and his squadron. Hyder Ally had placed a strong garrison in the
Fort, and occupied many strong holds within that Province and on
its borders.</p>

<p>Preparatory for this object a number of the Company's troops
reached Nagore on the 21st of October, which were soon headed by
General Monro, who landed from the Superbe. Sir Edward Hughes
disembarked his Marines, consisting of 443, on the same day, and a
battalion of 827 seamen upon the 22d. The looked for shift of the
Monsoon, and lateness of the season prompted the most active
measures. Owing to a heavy surf the cannon and all necessary
implements were conveyed by rafts to the shore, in which the zeal of
our Sailors, under the superintendance of Captain Ball, was most
praiseworthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy having thrown up strong lines flanked by redoubts,
to defend the approaches to Negapatam, they were stormed and
carried on the night of the 29th; much of the success and glory of
which very justly attached to the Seamen and Marines, whose
intrepidity was never more conspicuous. They also evinced an
unrelaxed zeal in prosecuting the necessary works of labour. During
the siege two sorties were attempted by the garrison, which originally
consisted of 8000 men, but in each they were quickly repulsed.
After a severe and well aimed fire, from the 3d to the 12th of
November, the Dutch proposed terms which were accepted.</p>

<p>During the whole course of this fatiguing service, 17 Seamen fell,
and 27 were wounded, and the detail of Marines was 13 killed, and
29 casualties, most of whom died; besides a number of both who
became victims to sudden cramps, the effects of hard duty amidst
the rains.</p>

<p>The happy results of this conquest were the immediate evacuation
of every post in the Tanjore by Hyder's troops, and the return to
allegiance of all those petty Princes who had been seduced, by him,
from their obedience to the Nabob of the Carnatic.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October the Seamen and Marines were re-embarked;
when, following up his farther plans, the Admiral set
sail for Trincomale upon the 2d of December, where he arrived
the 4th. Early in the succeeding morning the Marines, to whom
two field pieces were attached, were again put on shore, and they
were soon joined by a body of Seamen, who, with some Seapoy
pioneers, instantly formed and marched towards the fort of Trincomale.
While its Governor was employed in framing terms of capitulation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Lieut. Samuel Orr, at the head of the Marine Grenadier Company,
intrepidly rushed through the gateway, and saved him the trouble
of such a discussion&mdash;taking prisoners three Officers and 40 men.
This bold exploit led to the most important consequences, as the fort
commanded, with 10 pieces of cannon, the only place where the
requisite stores could be landed for the Army. The enemy's defences
now became limited to Fort Ostenburgh, situated on the top of a hill
which swept the harbour, and on the summit of another above it,
where there was posted an Officer's guard. From this they were
driven by a detachment of Seamen and Marines, who in every essay
were entrusted to execute those hazardous and honorable duties. A
summons was then tendered to the Governor, whose reply was firm.
Finding that he was not to be intimidated by threats, a general storm
was planned and executed on the 11th by 450 Seamen and Marines,
who, in column, and their flanks covered by pioneers, followed by
20 Sailors with scaling ladders, and supported by a reserve of six
companies of both descriptions, advanced against the fort early on the
morning of that day. These were farther strengthened by some
native troops in the rear.</p>

<p>A Serjeant's party of Marines, in front of the whole, most promptly
got into the embrasures, unperceived by the enemy, who, being
seconded with much alacrity, the Dutch were finally driven from
their works, the fort gained, and with it all the ships in the harbour.
Much do I regret in not being able to give the name of this gallant
Serjeant, who seemed to have combined talents with spirit. To
commemorate the worthy deeds of the meanest Soldier, is a tribute
justly due to him. The extensive observance of it would tend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
rouse emulation, and the jealous pride of character. He who knows
that he stands on the page of record, will be loth to forfeit so
honorable a distinction. It is a conscious dignity which will accompany
him into society, when his Country no longer wants his services;
would diffuse its loyal influence amongst the private walks of life,
and reanimate the possessor to become a ready Volunteer under every
public emergency. If disabled by years, he may, perhaps, have an
offspring, whom he cheerfully sends forth to battle, not the obdurate
and callous victims to injured laws, not the mercenary and wretched
auxiliaries of necessitous expedient, but the manly and independent assertors
of Britain's rights and freedom. In resigned confidence, most
willingly would he entrust their destinies to a corps, where courage
and conduct never remain unnoticed, and are neither forgotten or
pass away without recompence.</p>

<p>Fort Ostenburgh was not gained, however, without a contest and
loss; Lieutenant Long, who commanded a company of Seamen, was
slain, besides 20 non-commissioned and private Sailors and Marines;
Lieutenant Wolseley, of the Royal Navy, and Lieutenant Orr, of the
Marine Grenadier Company, who officiated as Brigade Major with
much credit to himself throughout this service, were wounded, as
well as 40 of both descriptions.&mdash;Humanity, the brightest gem in the
cap of a Soldier, became the property of each assaulter; who, when
resistance ceased, spared, in every instance, his suppliant foe.
Thus were our unnatural enemies expelled from the coast of
Coromandel. Unanimity, the sure presage of success, was early
apparent, and uniformly prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot yield a higher testimony, as to the merits of my Corps, than
that which was bestowed by Sir Edward Hughes, in these words:
"The whole of the Officers, who have been landed from the
squadron for the attack of Negapatam, and this place, (Trincomale),
have, on all occasions, manifested much honor, courage, and good
conduct, and the private Seamen and Marines have acted with
great steadiness and bravery." Major Geils, of the East India
Company's Engineers, evinced great professional knowledge in his
department.</p>

<p>After a most active campaign to the southward, during the
progress of which Earl Cornwallis appeared in his wonted attitudes
of a great and zealous Officer, the affairs of America were much on
the decline, and it was not from their own energies alone they could
now hope for that independence which had been their sanguine
avowal, and the summit of all their aims. Every military resource
began to fail in the summer of 1781, and it was only by one bold
effort, or an instantaneous appeal for foreign aid, that their desponding
troops could be longer kept together, or their expiring prospects be
rekindled.</p>

<p>At this awful period the genius of Washington was exerted as a
Politician as well as a General. Mons. Barras had arrived at Rhode
Island to assume the command of the French squadron there, whither
the Rebel Chief hastened to impart the secrets of his anxious heart.
In a conference with General Rochambeau a joint attack upon New
York was designed; for which future purpose, Washington in a
formal demand urged the immediate completion of every battalion in
his Army, as well as a strong levy from New England. The bearer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
these dispatches, with all his papers, fell into the hands of the British,
under Sir H. Clinton, who considered it his duty to prepare against
the meditated blow. Orders were accordingly transmitted to Earl
Cornwallis to detach from his Army in Virginia, when mutual discussions
betwixt those distinguished Commanders ensued, upon which
I feel no authority to enlarge, that finally limited his Lordship to the
defence of York Town and Gloucester, in the River Chesapeak,
upon the 22d of August.</p>

<p>The French and American Armies united at the close of June,
but they could attempt nothing against the formidable position
occupied by General Clinton, at Kingsbridge, or could they strike
at any other quarter without the support of a superior fleet. After a
tedious suspence, news reached them of the approach of Admiral
De Grasse, who intimated his intention of entering the Chesapeak.
After having indicated views upon New York, the combined force
suddenly struck across the Jerseys, in order to co-operate and level all
their power against the defenceless posts of York Town and Gloucester.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel Hood reached Sandy Hook on the 28th of August,
when the command devolving upon Rear Admiral Greaves, he put
to sea on the 31st with 19 sail of the line, the day after De Grasse
had anchored in the Chesapeak with 28. The French Admiral
immediately commenced the blockade of York River, having detached
four of these to carry on different services in James River, and with
the rest bringing up in Lynn-haven-bay.</p>

<p>The British fleet got sight of the Capes of Virginia on the morning
of the 5th of September, and in a few hours observed the French
working out in a very confused manner, forming their line as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
best could, after clearing Cape Henry. Sir Samuel Hood then led
the van with his division, whose acute eye, noticing the moment of
striking a decisive blow, he resolved to seize the occasion by soliciting
his second, Captain Reynolds (the present Lord Ducie) in the
Monarch, to lead him down within point blank shot of the scattered
enemy. To this order Capt. Reynolds's reply was, "That I will, Sir
Samuel, with a most sincere pleasure." In an instant his ship obeyed
the summons, and was advancing with hasty strides to victory,
but her signal was made to haul the wind, and to resume her station
in the line.&mdash;An action afterwards commenced, in no respect worthy
of notice, but that of rendering the gallantry of Captains Robinson
and Molloy, of the Shrewsbury and Intrepid, very highly conspicuous.</p>

<p>This was followed by the return of each fleet to the anchorage
it had left. De Grasse preferred the emancipation of America, to a
precarious combat on the sea.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton attempted a diversion in Connecticut, but
nothing could attract General Washington from his main object.
United to Rochambeau they pushed on to the head of Elk River,
where their troops were received on board of French transports, and
soon joined those at Williamsburgh under Generals La Fayette and
St. Simon.</p>

<p>Moving forward to York Town, Earl Cornwallis withdrew
within its works on the 29th of September, with the resolve of
preserving it, until relieved by promised succours from the northward.
Some parties of Marines, from frigates in the river, were incorporated
with his garrison, of whom his Lordship was pleased to make honourable
mention in the public details of his persevering defence. Speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of a redoubt which was advanced over a creek upon the right of the
British Lines, he says, that it was maintained against the fire of
several batteries, with <i>uncommon</i> gallantry, by about 120 men of the
23d Regiment and Marines. This body, under the command of
Captain Apthorpe, and subsequently strengthened by detachments
under Lieutenant Colonel Johnstone, received his Lordship's most
grateful encomiums at the unfortunate close of all their operations.
The post at Gloucester fell with that of York Town, whose garrison
met with those soothing attentions and sympathy, which a brave
enemy ever extends to a worthy opponent.</p>

<p>Admiral Kempenfelt, in December, achieved the capture of some
transports and store ships, protected by a very superior force, which
demonstrated that his great nautical abilities were not confined to
theory alone. His exploit, in sight of De Guichen, with nearly
double his own strength, was much enhanced, when we remember
that it occurred in days too barren of such examples.</p>

<p>Some brilliant single actions, at sea, occurred during the year,
amongst the foremost of which was that fought between the Nonsuch,
of 64, Sir James Wallace, and a French 80 gun ship. After a loss
of 90 Seamen and Marines killed and wounded, Sir James could not
follow his flying foe. Lieutenant Fowke, of Marines, a most
promising Officer, was killed in the Pearl, Captain Montague, in
an action which terminated in the capture of L'Esperance Letter of
Marque, on the coast of America.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXXVI" id="CHAP_XXXVI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XXXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>wenty-one thousand three hundred and five Marines were
voted for the year 1782.</p>

<p>Accounts were received in March of the fall of Minorca, after
sustaining a siege which immortalized its defender, General Murray,
and his brave garrison. It was scurvy alone that conquered it,
which a body of Seamen, formed into a <i>Marine Corps</i>, withstood.
Many were the honourable traits of patience and zeal shewn by the
Soldiery of every description, through sufferings under disease and
fatiguing duties. The Royal Artillery was, as usual, conspicuous
for their courage and exertions.</p>

<p>The disasters of the last year, and a change of Administration,
whose views and sentiments, as to the future conduct of the war,
were very opposite to those of their predecessors, produced a suspension
of every offensive attempt upon the American Continent.</p>

<p>The West Indies was doomed to become the theatre of our Naval
efforts, and the scene on which to revive our drooping glory. Sir
Samuel Hood commanded the English Fleet, in that quarter, after
his return from America; but was opposed to De Grasse at the head
of overpowering numbers. No example of our history can afford
a brighter instance of daring enterprize, with practical science, than
was evinced by the British Chief in attempting the relief of St. Kitts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Although it was not succeeded by fortunate events, still that does
not shade its merit. His able plan of attacking an immense superiority
at anchor in the road of Basseterre, was superseded by the French
Admiral, who, decoyed by his able manÅuvres, relinquished that
advantage, which was quickly seized by his acute opponent.</p>

<p>In the different actions that followed, Captain, now Col. Strickland,
and Lieuts. Forster and Griffiths, of Marines, were wounded.</p>

<p>A want of troops placed not within Sir Samuel's power to raise
the siege of Brimstone Hill, which held out as long as possible, but
at last capitulated on honourable terms.</p>

<p>My bounds will not allow me to extend these details, in which
the Marine Corps bore always a zealous, though a subordinate share.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Hood soon after joined Sir George Rodney, who
brought out a powerful reinforcement of ships, that was most judiciously
augmented by the single arrivals of others; by which method
the West India Fleet became superior to the enemy, without their
being apprized of it.</p>

<p>A train of success had elated De Grasse, who, with a mighty
force, put to sea from Martinique on the 8th of April, in the certain
confidence of adding Jamaica to his other conquests. The British
Fleet soon followed him, and a partial affair took place on the 9th;
when an opportunity was lost by the French, of making a serious
impression on the English van, under Sir Samuel Hood, unsupported
by the centre and rear, from a casual failure of wind, under the
island of Dominique.</p>

<p>Little hope of bringing the enemy to a decisive battle continued
from that day, until the 11th, when a general chace was directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
against two ships, whose recent damages had forced to leeward of
their fleet, and exposed them to capture. Observing their danger,
De Grasse, who might have weathered Guadaloupe, sacrificing that
object, bore up to save them.</p>

<p>The ZelÃ© falling on board the Ville de Paris during the night,
by which she lost her main-mast, was chaced in the morning by the
Monarch, to support which ship the French Admiral hazarded all,
with his united force. Captain Reynolds was then recalled to his
station in the line, and the conflict began at seven, on the 12th of
April. That glorious day, with its important consequences, at so
critical a period of our history, must be recognized by the latest
posterity. To particularize any belongs not to me on so great an
occasion, where all were entitled to praise. The high talents of
Sir Charles Douglas afforded his gallant superior much useful aid
through the day.</p>

<p>De Grasse being carried a captive to that island which he had
but a little while ago viewed the certain spot of his triumphs as a
conqueror, is an impressive example of the vicissitudes of fortune.
He had the mortification to witness those grateful effusions of its
natives, poured forth to their saviours, which, under different
circumstances, would have been offered to him under the constrained
forms of political adulation.</p>

<p>In this long-contested action four Captains of Marines were
wounded, but only two were named in the public dispatch&mdash;Bell and
Bagg. Lieut. Mounier was killed, and the Subalterns Breedon,
Buchan, Harris, and Laban were wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Respecting Lieut. Mounier, of the Torbay, I am led to notice
the following anecdote, as having been narrated to me by Lieut.
Collins of that ship. In the morning, after the two hostile fleets
had formed the line and were approaching each other, Mounier,
whose spirit in single combat had previously been fatally experienced
by his antagonist, expressed a sensation of an immediate change in
his destiny. Under this impression he requested Lieut. Collins to
play a game at picquet to divert the time, until they opened fire.
This they continued to do, when each went to his respective station.
The sad presentiment was soon realized to poor Mounier, who was
early in the battle cut in two, and the greater part of his remains
were scattered on the sea.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Hughes encountered, in four different actions, Monsieur
Suffrein, one of the bravest Officers in the Naval service of
France. Possessing, in each, a great advantage in numbers, the
utmost height of valour, but productive of no immediate effects, was
exhibited in all by the British Fleet. The French Admiral shewed
himself worthy of the trust confided in him by his Sovereign.</p>

<p>In one of these battles, fought on the 12th of April, the Monmouth,
Captain Alms, suffered extremely, and was particularly
distinguished. All the Marines on her poop were either killed or
wounded, excepting Captain Pearce and Lieut. Mounier, who nobly
volunteered to assist in fighting her guns on the main deck, after they
had lost all the brave men under their own command.</p>

<p>The discomfiture of the combined armaments before Gibraltar in
September of this year, must ever stand as a memorable event upon
our annals. Humanity and victory walked hand in hand, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
usual, adorned the national character, on that grand occasion.
The long-tried valour of General Elliot, and the spirited services of
Sir Roger Curtis, with those under their controul, were sealed and
consummated by deeds of mercy, which will never be forgotten by
our enemies. That fortress was soon after relieved by Lord Howe,
under circumstances most honourable to his Lordship, the Officers,
Seamen, and Marines who seconded him.</p>

<p>In every incidental combat at sea, during the currency of 1782,
our wonted prowess was at all times conspicuous. The short, but
well-contested fight of Captain Jervis (now Earl St. Vincent) in the
Foudroyant, with Le Pegase, afforded a powerful evidence how
much success is dependent on seamanship and discipline. While a
dreadful carnage was the Frenchman's lot, the English loss was
confined to a few slightly wounded, among whom was numbered her
Commander, whose professional address obtained a bloodless victory.</p>

<p>The names of Pole, Luttrell, and Salter, were destined to be
conspicuous, and their encomiums transcended to Lieuts. Pownol and
Rankine, of my Corps, for their steady co-operation and bravery in
the Success and Mediator.</p>

<p>The year closed with negociations for a general peace, the
provisionary articles of which were mutually signed at Paris by
Commissioners from Britain and America, on the 22d of November.
These were soon after followed by the exchange of preliminary
articles with France and Spain, on the 20th of January, 1783.</p>

<p>Peace was most ardently desired by all the contending Powers,
and its attainment was marked by sincerity and cool discussion.
America foresaw a disorganized army and impoverished resources,
while France and Spain, feeling their quickly decaying finances,
most cordially united to accelerate the happy event. The decisive
battle of the 12th of April, and their signal repulse from Gibraltar,
had also due weight in the scale of consideration and expediency.</p>

<p>Amidst the awful storm, Britain began to emerge, by degrees, from
under the heavy cloud which had long overcast her political horizon,
and to reclaim her ancient seat amongst the nations. Every subordinate
occasion that called forth her Naval energies, seemed to
display a spirit worthy of the brightest periods of her Maritime
glory.</p>

<p>However delicate the topic, I am still induced to notice the
reiterated instances of baneful mutiny in our Fleet, during this year
of returning tranquillity. It is a lamentable truth that examples of
indiscipline were as common as they were successful, and to the plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of compromise which was <i>then</i> pursued, may be traced, in part, that
predilection for revolt which agitated the minds of our Seamen during
the late contest&mdash;crimes, for which their unparalleled achievements
have amply atoned to their Country, but such as never can find a
palliative within their own breasts, or an extenuation from any pen
that is guided by an impartial impulse.</p>

<p>The demonstrations of loyalty and zeal, in every Marine Detachment,
during this turbulent era, although not realized by deeds,
still evinced a readiness to seal them with their lives, in the support
of good order. These fatal means which were used to appease the
spirit, hushed his murmurs indeed, but they invigorated the growth
of the untamed monster. After the various and meritorious services
of the Marine corps, during two successive wars, at a time when
their loyal zeal was conspicuous to their Country, when their utility
and subordination were in every mouth, a heavy reduction in its
establishment took place. It was with equal surprize, and general
regret, that this faithful body of men became limited to 4495, and to
70 companies, with a parsimonious allowance of Field Officers. Such
a popular branch of the public force was evidently small for supplying
the ships of war in commission, and for the important duties of
guarding our naval arsenals. But as the judicious policy of the
present day, has adopted a more liberal and patriotic system respecting
the corps of Marines, I deem myself precluded from that range of
comment upon the method of anterior times, which I should have
otherwise felt an authority to claim.</p>

<p>Another vindictive conflict occurred in the East, but without
any important consequences; in which Sir Edward Hughes, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
hitherto, nobly maintained the honor of the British flag, against
Admiral Suffrein and superior numbers. The sound of peace soon
after reached their ears, and closed all their differences.</p>

<p>Acts of generous hospitality, and works of mercy in the western
world, superseded stratagem in war, and the thirst of fame.</p>

<p>Prince William Henry, now his Royal Highness the Duke of
Clarence, whom professional zeal had carried to that quarter, was
at the cessation of hostilities, under that able master, Lord Hood.
Since his entry into the Navy he had shewn a peculiar attention to
every branch of its duties, and had afforded the earliest presage of
the most distinguished talents upon its hazardous, but popular
element. A princely wish to qualify himself for this honourable
calling, had urged him to forego all the luxuries of his station, and
to risk a life naturally dear to his august family, and deservedly
valued by all who had the privilege of his intercourse, in a clime,
where no one can count upon to-morrow. It was not his lot, indeed,
to wage war in it, but to behold the refined manners of a gallant
enemy tranquillized into a cordial friend, and to be the Agent of
Providence in rescuing, from a seemingly irrevocable doom, some of his
condemned countrymen, whose misguided patriotism had stimulated
disaffection within the Spanish Province of Louisiana.</p>

<p>The elegant attentions of Mons. de Bellecomb, at Cape Francois,
were still outdone by the noble humanity of Governor Don Galvez.
This brave Spaniard placed the forfeited lives of those unfortunate
delinquents, at his Royal disposal. It was the most precious gift
that could have been tendered to a British Prince&mdash;who was
recognized under this great and solemn offering as sharing in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
generous sympathies of an Englishman. The hour which permitted
him to restore those wretched victims, in a foreign land, to their
native society, must be reviewed as the happiest of his life. It must
still yield many a consoling reflection in his retirement, and although
restrained from adding to the triumphs of our Realm, by deeds of
carnage, he may yet rejoice that he stands upon the records of mercy
and benevolence by the most exalted displays of fellow feeling.</p>

<p>By the definitive articles of peace America found herself an
Independent Empire. Recent injuries alienated her citizens from
our Country; but similarity of manners, the dictates of interest, and
allayed prejudices must, ere long, re-unite us in the bonds of friendship.
The retreat of Washington from the head of her Armies, unambitious
of recompense or power, forms one of the grandest examples of
human virtue ever given to the world, and must immortalize his
name through every stage of its existence.</p>

<p>Holland was compelled to suppress her phlegm, and to mourn
over her degraded character, and commercial losses.</p>

<p>Few incidents of moment occurred within the intervals of 1783
and 1792, connected with my retrospect. A voluntary embarkation
of Officers and men, for our distant settlement in New South Wales,
occurred in 1785 which has eventually afforded scope for the able
pen of Lieutenant Colonel Tench, and has hitherto given grounds
for asserting the untarnished discipline of the Marine corps, when
mingled even with the contaminating orders of vice and infamy.
In other respects the same dull routine of detached services took place
from year to year. During this period also many were the suppliant
petitions of our establishment for its melioration, but sorry I am that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
on casting an eye upon the details of each revolving season, they are
unmarked by any auspicious results, excepting the institution of a
retired establishment, and the addition of 5 companies in 1791.</p>

<p>It was found that farther exertions were still necessary to place
them on the high list of public recompence, and that the faithful
discharge of ten years duty in peace, had but little influence in
strengthening their claims for favor.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">W</span>ithin the womb of American liberty, was partly contained
that revolution in France, which, after a long and sanguinary
struggle, has not as yet accomplished any permanent system. It is
not my task to retrace its extensive causes, and it would be
presumptuous to anticipate its final issue. In this, reason, unguided
by precedents, is soon lost in the labyrinths of speculation.</p>

<p>Confining myself to such points alone as affect the dignity of my
Country, or the honor of my corps, fancy shall not assume the reins,
but I will strike at once to that momentous day which again
involved those arbiters of Europe in all the horrors of war.</p>

<p>A conventional decree of 19th November, 1792, circulated
through every Country, <i>and translated into every language</i>, seemed
to represent the French Nation as the encouragers and protectors of
reform in every State. At this period Britain was recovering fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
from her late disastrous efforts. An unexampled influx of wealth,
added to her native joys of contentment and freedom. An edict so
much militating against the internal peace of every society, therefore,
naturally roused the watchful jealousy of our Government. Discussions
ensued, which were agitated with temper, until those libertines
in the cause of emancipation, brought their amiable Monarch to the
scaffold. I blush to say that there were even Englishmen who were
capable of extenuating the bloody deed, while there were others, but
under a more generous impulse, who, tasting pure freedom themselves,
wished that the blessing might also flow through all the channels of
mankind. A set of free thinkers in politics, and Philanthropists in
theory, also started up, who, with all the enthusiasm of laudable
zeal worshipped a statue erected by an American Stay-Maker, on
which were inscribed "The Rights of Man." The mania of that
day, thank God, is extinguished, and an Englishman has now only
to contrast the fawning attitude of the French People, under the
present yoke of a foreign and unprincipled Usurper, with their
uncontroled and licentious barbarity towards a good but fallen King,
in order to form his opinions, and to suppress his sympathies in behalf
of a nation, which, to gain its own ideal liberties, has uniformly
aimed to desolate and enslave the world. He must also cease to
admire the boasted victories and conquests of its soldiery, few of
whom but do not now feel those chains which their triumphs have
forged, and what all these once brave legions dare not now wrest
from the hands of <i>one man</i>.&mdash;But to resume my narrative&mdash;</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1792 a small addition was granted to the
corps of Marines, and a much greater took place early in 93, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
consequence of the intermeddling policy of France, and the war which
followed it.</p>

<p>The narrow views that had influenced so great a reduction at the
peace of 1783, were bitterly apparent at the commencement of
hostilities. In every contest our enemies begin with superior advantages,
from their despotic means. Impress is precarious and slow&mdash;compulsive
registration enforced by terror, brings forth a host at once.
It is to the faithful Marine Soldier who knows not the meaning of
desertion, that the nation, under such sudden emergencies, is often
obliged to have recourse, in equipping as well as manning her
fleets; for it is not in human nature to place confidence in that man
who has been constrained to serve, and who recognises not either
a voluntary will, or a sacred obligation to discharge his allotted
duties.</p>

<p>It has always been remarked, that the corps of Marines recruit
more successfully in every part of our isles, where their nature is
ascertained, than any other under his Majesty. From this circumstance
must have originated the motive of low bounties being given
by its parties in 1793, while those of the line, and other departments
were considerably higher.</p>

<p>This restriction upon our increase loaded our service with
difficulties, and presented almost insurmountable barriers to the
attainment of that knowledge of tactics, in which every Marine
Officer and Soldier should be conversant previous to his embarkation.
For a time there seemed but little disposition to remedy the former errors,
until the imperious demands of an increasing Navy urged the adoption
of more active measures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>At this period of surrounding danger the liberal patriotism of the
town of Manchester was highly conspicuous, and gave a local spur
to access in strengthening the neglected ranks of the Marine corps.
What enhanced its manly and honest zeal, was, that the expression
of it was almost coeval with that day, on which our Gracious Sovereign
unbosomed his insulted feelings, and the perils that hovered round
his Country, to a convened Legislature.</p>

<p>A sum of Â£5501 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> was soon subscribed by that Loyal
Society, which was applied to the auxiliary purpose of raising and
sending forth to battle 1085 recruits, between the 19th of February
and 3d of October, when a General Meeting, to inspect and close
the accounts of their acting Committee, was dissolved, and their
thanks were tendered to William Douglas, Esq. its Chairman.</p>

<p>These volunteers were levied under the endearing and uniting
name of "<i>The Manchester Marine Corps</i>." My feelings lead me to
diverge more extensively upon this meritorious theme, which my
bounds, however, compel me to close with an earnest hope, that
while the virtuous action shall long stand registered on our annals,
its imitative influence may also be felt by the present, and transcend
to the latest generations of my countrymen.</p>

<p>Owing to an inadequate establishment, from the cause assigned,
many ships put to sea with only half a complement of Marines, while
others had none at all. What prevented Capt. Faulkener, in the
Venus, from consummating a gallant action by victory, but this
deficiency? In many cases, regiments of the line were substituted;
an alternative which can only be the offspring of necessity, but not
the suggestion of public good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The British arms were very early triumphant in the West, under
the joint auspices of Major General Cuyler and Sir John Laforey.</p>

<p>Their force which included Major (now Colonel) Bright, 1
Lieutenant, 2 Serjeants, 1 Drummer, and 27 private Marines, not
amounting to 400 men, carried Fort Castries by storm, and with it
the island of Tobago, garrisoned by greater numbers. Some untoward
circumstances arising from the cowardice or treachery of a guide,
added to a dark night, occasioned a small derangement in our
approach to the attack, but it was amply attoned by a general
intrepidity in the troops; the main body of which pushed boldly
towards the barrier, who attracted the whole attention of the enemy,
while the flank companies of the 9th and 60th regiments entered their
works. This affair was achieved by the bayonet, with little loss on
either side; for mercy, as usual, was shewn by Englishmen to the
vanquished.</p>

<p>St. Pierre and Micquelon also soon became easy conquests. Such
are the crouded and brilliant instances of this war, that I cannot
venture upon a minute detail of any, or render justice to their merits.</p>

<p>Lord Hood, who had been recently called forth by his Country,
in the hour of threatened danger, and who, upon its having been
dispelled, had again become the citizen, was once more placed at
the head of a powerful fleet. This he destined to carry to the
Mediterranean, where it was his lot to perform very important
services, throughout which, he approved himself an accomplished
adept in the schools of a Sully and a Marlborough. Never since our
existence before, have the talents of a <i>Naval Officer</i> been exerted on
so wide a field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Untrained to the courtly habits of life, uninstructed in the
arts of diplomacy, the world usually attaches <i>to him</i> no embellishments
of character, but professional bravery, uncorruptible zeal,
impressive unadorned manners. The Nation, however, could not
have had a more dignified representative, a cooler agent, or a more
indefatigable servant than Lord Hood upon so trying an occasion, and
amidst such mingled and arduous duties. His intercourse with the
deputies from different departments in the South of France, was
guided by wisdom and led to success, while his appeals to their community
breathed a well timed humanity towards that oppressed land.</p>

<p>After an interchange of terms, the Honourable Capt. Elphinstone
(now Lord Keith) took possession of Fort La Malgue with 1800
troops and Marines upon the 28th of August. The fleet of Spain
hove in sight, anchored, and reinforced that post with 1000 men.
At first the inhabitants of Toulon, though royalists, were still jealous
of the issue of things, but they were tranquillized in all their fears,
by a solemn assurance, that the place and ships were held in trust for
Louis the 17th, their lawful Sovereign. The approach of a part of
Carteaux army, to Ollioules, produced a very spirited attack from
La Malgue, headed by Capt. Elphinstone, and consisting of 600
Spaniards, British troops and Marines, who drove a superior enemy
from that village, and took their cannon, ammunition, and some
prisoners. The dispositions of the English commander were masterly,
and attested his abilities to wage war on either element.</p>

<p>Lord Mulgrave arrived at Toulon early in September, and assumed
the command of the combined detachments, with the local rank of
Brigadier General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The Marines of the fleet were dispersed over the different posts of
defence, some of which were cannonaded by the enemy, daily
increasing in numbers.</p>

<p>All the military talents of Lord Mulgrave were requisite at this
trying juncture. They were soon displayed in the most active
measures, by occupying situations essential for checking the enemy's
attacks, and affording a temporary security to many extensive objects,
until reinforcements should arrive.</p>

<p>His Lordship had to guard against the insults of the Army of
Le Poype on the East, as well as that of Carteaux on the West, in
which he was materially aided also by the activity and steady bravery
of the Officers and Seamen of the fleet. At this time too, the
Spaniards were actuated by a spirit of cordial union.</p>

<p>On the 28th of September, a seasonable supply of 2800 Sardinian
and Neapolitan troops arrived, who, in three days after, in conjunction
with the other allied corps, of which the British Marines
formed one, had an opportunity of signalizing themselves, led by
Lord Mulgrave himself, in recovering the important heights of
Pharon, which had been surprized and carried under cover of a fog,
upon the 30th.</p>

<p>To the rapid enterprize of his Lordship, as much as the seconding
valour of every subordinate Soldier and Seaman, may justly be ascribed
the glory and success of the 1st of October. Very honorable mention
was made of Serjeant Moreno, and three privates of the Spanish
Marine Corps, who, with a daring and judicious zeal, traced out the
line of march for the allied column on the right, to within pistol shot
of the works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Directed by genius, the laurel was obtained, and its value
enhanced by a very trifling loss, while that of the French exceeded
1400 killed and wounded; Lieutenant Carter, of Marines, was
amongst the English wounded.</p>

<p>A very bold sortie, from Fort Mulgrave, took place on the 8th of
October, against the enemy's batteries, opposite the Hauteur
de Grasse, evidently constructed with a view to incommode the fleet.
In this, 50 British Marines co-operated, and shared in the honor of
destroying their guns on the Hauteur de Reinier; a service which
was peculiarly allotted to the seamen under Lieutenant Serocold.
Fort Pomet, partly garrisoned by my corps, had been exposed to a
severe cannonade; particularly from 2 guns and 1 mortar above it,
which allowed no tests but of steady courage.</p>

<p>Captain Elphinstone bore testimony of Marine spirit, in an attack
from Fort Pharon upon the French forces to the eastward, when
Captain Dexter was distinguished for his services.</p>

<p>Much am I inclined to diverge upon the meritorious acts of all,
but my scope is necessarily limited.</p>

<p>Lord Mulgrave resigned the command of the combined troops to
Major General O'Hara, upon the 27th of October, after the most
creditable discharge of his trust.</p>

<p>The British posts were extremely wide, and the duties of all were
of the most fatiguing kind; but they were supported with the fortitude
of Soldiers.</p>

<p>One of the most brilliant events of this checquered warfare,
although unnoticed in any of the official details of it, and generally
unknown, was meritedly attached to Lieutenant (afterwards Captain)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Thomas Nailor, who was entrusted with the defence of a fort, having
under him a little garrison of 120 men, principally Marines. A
body of 2000 French moved on to attack him upon the morning of a
day, with which I am uninformed as to date, under cover of a fog,
and sanguine in the hope of surprising him. But he was on the alert,
and prepared to receive them. With a thoughtful but unshaken
valour he awaited the onset, ordering his little band to reserve their
fire, until the republicans were close, and to maintain it by platoons;
but by no means in a scattered form. A Neapolitan Lieutenant
Colonel had thrown himself into the fort when on the eve of its being
attempted, but he fell early in the conflict. After repeated essays to
carry it with those superior numbers, the French relinquished the
field with the loss of nearly 400 killed and wounded; casting back
an eye of disappointment, mingled with admiration, of their undaunted
opponents.</p>

<p>That young man is now no more. Owing to bad health, he
retreated from public to private life, both of which he adorned by
modest merit, the mildest manners, and most intrinsic worth. The
final destiny of man, but recently closed his life unstained by
dishonor.</p>

<p>During the progress of this siege too, a very flattering occasion
intervened of testifying the personal zeal of Lieutenant (now Captain)
Burdwood, in one of the sorties from Toulon. Embarking in it
originally as a Volunteer with the Light Company of the Royals, his
talents were decreed to conduct the retreat of its remains, after having
been deprived of its Officers. So much were his merits appreciated
by that gallant corps, that a deputation of Serjeants waited on him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the following day, to solicit that, if a similar opportunity should
again offer, he would give a preference by attaching himself to the
First Regiment of Foot. The Officers of it also, anxious to express
their feelings, voted him a <i>perpetual member</i> of their mess; upon
which books, his name now stands in record of their gratitude.</p>

<p>Jealous feuds were apparent in the breast of the Spanish Commander,
Don Langara, early in October. It has since appeared that
he spoke the sentiments of his court, which was basely negociating
with the authorized agents of the diabolical Robespierre. Every
trifling incident was seized as a subject far contention, and the
subsequent conduct of the Spanish troops warrants the suspicion that
this influence was general. The address of Lord Hood, under this
dilemma, was great and manly.</p>

<p>The Enemy, from constant reinforcements, became daring in their
attacks. On the 15th of November they attempted Fort Mulgrave
on the Hauteur de Grasse, with a large force.</p>

<p>This post was occupied by the Spaniards on the right, who soon
gave way, and retreated, firing their musquets in the air. To Capt.
D. Campbell of the 2d battalion of Royals, and Lieut. Lemoine of
the corps of Artillery, was owing the repulse of the enemy, and
saving that very important post.</p>

<p>Towards the close of November, the French having opened
against Fort Malbousket, and their shells also reaching the town, it
was requisite to dislodge them from the ground they held. A body of
2300, under Gen. Dundas, of which the Marines composed a part,
advanced against it, under many obstructions, on the 30th, drove the
enemy from it, but, under an ill judged impetuosity, rushed onwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
instead of maintaining the post they had gained. The republicans
gathering in numbers, in turn recovered all, and took Gen. O'Hara
prisoner, after he was wounded, and had used the utmost endeavours
to rally our Soldiers. This Officer foresaw not the unfortunate ardency,
but had arrived at the post in order to arrange its defence. He
unhappily fell a sacrifice to his overstrained zeal.</p>

<p>Little hope now remained of preserving Toulon; the enemy,
from his numbers, pushing matters to a close. Sickness began its
ravages; and no reinforcements were at hand to supply them.</p>

<p>The very material post of Fort Mulgrave, partly garrisoned by
British Marines, was much annoyed by shells, without having the
means of retreat from their effects. On the 17th of December, at two
in the morning, the French advanced to storm it. Here again the
Spaniards gave way, and it was in vain that English courage alone
was exerted in supporting their quarter of it. From hence our men
retreated to Fort Balaguier, under cover of the different posts on the
heights. After dawn, one unceasing fire against the different posts
on Pharon, commenced, which ended in the republicans gaining
possession of the mountain that overlooks Toulon. These reiterated
disasters could not now be retrieved. To withdraw every detachment
within the town of Toulon, for re-embarkation, became the
only alternative. On the 18th it was directed that the whole
combined forces should assemble near Fort La Malgue with secrecy,
and about ten at night they began their march and the evacuation of
Toulon. Avoiding the Fort of St. Catharine, which had been
shamefully quitted during the day, without orders, the whole struck
through a sally post, by which they gained an advanced part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
road, and arrived at Fort Malgue, where they formed on the rising
ground above the shore. The Army reached the ships by day
break, without loss.</p>

<p>General Dundas says, "it was impossible for him to express, but
in general terms, the high approbation due to the Officers and
men of the Regiments and Marines, for their exertions during a
service the most harassing, distressing, and severe, seldom
experienced by troops, for so long a time." The Royal Artillery
was included in this encomium, as well as the Sardinian, Spanish,
and French loyal auxiliaries.</p>

<p>It was supposed that Lieutenants John Williams, Barry, and
Lynn, with 71 Marines, besides other gallant companions of the
British Army, had fallen sacrifices in defending the posts of Mulgrave
and Fort Pharon, but all the former and many of the latter rejoined,
after having been prisoners, who now live ornaments to their corps.</p>

<p>Towards this seat of perilous duty Sir Sidney Smith had repaired
in a private character, which, however, did not restrain him from
tendering his services to Lord Hood. He was accordingly employed
to carry into execution the destruction of the ships in the inner road of
Toulon, the arsenals and magazines. Short was the time allowed
him, and many were the attending dangers. It called forth all the
resources of his ample mind, and all the courage of his intrepid
followers. Besides an open enemy, he had to counteract the schemes
of a treacherous friend, which had well nigh overwhelmed him and
his seamen, by the precipitate explosion of two powder ships, to which
the Spaniards set fire, instead of sinking them. The conduct of Langara,
throughout, but ill accorded with the reputed honor of his nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
It is not the calling of an Officer, and a brave man, to be the hidden
agent of perfidy. Although the plan laid down by Lord Hood was
well entitled to success, it still was not to that extent he wished.
From the conflagration at Toulon, however, may be dated the wide
triumphs of the British flag through the subsequent stages of the war,
an achievement which can never be forgotten by a grateful nation,
which must recognize its safety, and its commercial prosperity, in that
early event.</p>

<p>In whatever quarter of the globe we cast an eye each continued
to witness the exertions of the Marine Soldier. The convulsions at
St. Domingo called aloud for British protection, whither an expedition
sailed from Jamaica, under Commodore Ford. Proceeding first to
Jeremie, it entered into terms; after which the Europa, carrying his
broad pendant, went to Cape Nicola Mole, where she arrived on the
22d of September. On the following day, matters having been
arranged, Captain Robinson, an Officer of distinguished merit and
abilities, was landed with 50 Marines, to whom the Commodore
granted the Brevet rank of Major, and invested him with the command
of its garrison. This gentleman acquitted himself with so
much credit to himself that, when superseded in this important key
to St. Domingo by Lieutenant Colonel Dansey, every thing had been
so properly conducted, that no trouble accrued to his successor, in
the adjustments usually consequent upon such events. Commodore
Ford gave his cordial approbation of the firm and regular conduct of
the Seamen and Marines of his squadron, in the most unequivocal
language, and their steadiness through every allotted duty, in that
destructive clime, was uniformly observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The operations of the squadron and army, in the East, were most
active and early. Pondicherry, and many subordinate places
surrendered without much resistance, owing to the zealous intelligence
conveyed by Mr. Baldwin, British Consul, in Egypt, of the
commencement of hostilities.</p>

<p>Some gallant single actions were fought during 1793. That
between La Nymphe and La Cleopatra was well contested, and in
which Lieut. John Whitaker, of Marines, is mentioned, as having
ably seconded Sir Edward Pellew on the quarter deck. The former
was wounded in the course of it, besides 10 of his party killed or
maimed. Another equally brave, but not alike fortunate, happened
on the coast of America, betwixt the Boston, Captain Courtenay, and
L'Ambuscade, French frigate. That promising Officer, ever
anxiously in search of an occasion to distinguish himself, decoyed
his antagonist from Sandy Hook. They met and fought; during the
heat of the combat, one fatal shot decided the fate both of Captain
Courtenay, and Lieutenant Butler, of Marines. A sincere friendship
existed between them, and as they had been united in their lives, so
were they also united in their deaths. Those amiable young men
were hand in hand chanting every loyal Briton's anthem, "God save
the King," at the moment their golden pitchers were broken. Adored
by the crew, they unhappily left their guns to bid their departed
father a long adieu, but he was no more, and to this circumstance
alone was owing the Frenchman's escape, whom the Boston was
unable to follow.</p>

<p>The capture of La Reunion, by the Crescent, Captain Saumarez,
was a proof of English discipline, as the republican frigate sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a loss of 120 killed and wounded, without one accident on our side.
The Honorable Captain Yorke, in the Circe, hastened to share in
the glory, but was prevented by light winds.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">A</span> number of additional Companies were deemed necessary to the
corps of Marines, which was composed of 12,115 for the service of
1794. During this year a number of First Lieutenants were
appointed to Companies in Black Regiments; a transit which many
embraced.</p>

<p>A correspondence with General Paoli having been opened by
Lord Hood, relative to the state of Corsica, that active Officer
determined, in consequence, upon driving the French from all their
ports in the island.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this arduous business, the constancy and
persevering valour of the Naval Officers and Seamen were never more
conspicuous. To their scientific and laborious exertions in dragging
cannon to the top of a hill which commanded the Fort of La Convention,
must be ascribed the success against that important key to
St. Fiorenzo itself. The storm which was consequent upon it,
reflects high honor upon that shining Officer Col. (now Gen.) Moore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The Naval Chief was not contented with possession of the Gulf and
Fortress of St. Fiorenzo alone, but followed up his views also against
Bastia, the capital. This he resolved to attempt with the skeletons
of four regiments, serving in his fleet as Marines, and a brigade of
Seamen. The final surrender of that town and citadel, garrisoned
by 4000 French and Corsican Soldiers, to a besieging force of 1248,
and of mingled descriptions, must ever stand as one of the most
brilliant events that adorn our military history. His Lordship was
lavish in praise of all his brave coadjutors, which was repeated on the
reduction of Calvi and with it the fall of Corsica. This closed his
meritorious career.</p>

<p>The defenceless and disaffected state of the French West India
islands had prompted an enterprize against them, which sailed from
England towards the close of 1793. These objects were confided to
Sir John Jervis (now Earl St. Vincent) and Lieutenant General Sir
Charles Grey. The rapidity and success of all their movements
convinced their Country that the trust could not have been reposed
in more able hands.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival at Barbadoes little time was lost, when
their first efforts were levelled against the strong and valuable island
of Martinique. My bounds will not authorize me to enlarge upon the
train of operations, which preceded its surrender, so very honorable to
the talents and zeal of those distinguished Commanders, in most of
which, the corps of Marines appears to have had but a trifling share.
The chief duty, of an active nature, which fell to their lot was against
Fort St. Louis, upon which a combined attack was planned, by a
brigade of 1000 Seamen and Marines, under Commodore Thompson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and supported by Captains Riou, Rogers, and Baynton of the Royal
Navy, approaching from Point Negro towards its western side, while
it was assailed by the Asia and Zebra sloops in front, and harassed
by the enfilading fire of two batteries on shore. A body of Grenadiers
and Light Infantry, from the camps of La Coste and Sourriere, were
also to advance, on the land side, under the cover of a hill. This
joint attack was, however, anticipated by the unparalleled enterprize
and courage of Captain Faulkener, of the Zebra sloop, who dashed
close to the walls of the Fort, and carried it, at the head of his ship's
company of Seamen and Marines, at the very moment when the
republicans were in consultation about its defence.</p>

<p>Mons. Rochambeau, instead of turning the guns of Fort Bourbon
against the town, afterwards occupied by Colonel Symes and the flank
corps, as well as Fort Louis, both of which it commands, immediately
stipulated for its surrender, and the whole island, which took
place on the following day being the 21st of March. His Royal
Highness Prince Edward, (now Duke of Kent), who had lately
arrived from Canada, commanded at the Camp of La Coste, with
deserved credit.</p>

<p>No time was lost in proceeding against St. Lucia, which became
an easy conquest. The islands of the Saintes were likewise carried
by the Seamen and Marines of the Quebec, Blanche, Ceres, and
Rose. The reduction of Guadaloupe immediately followed, where
a landing was effected in the Ance de Gosier, of some infantry and
a body of 500 Seamen and Marines, under cover of the Winchelsea,
Lord Garlies, who, carrying his ship close to the enemy's batteries,
quickly silenced them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The assault of the Fort of La Fleur d'EpÃ©e, was attempted in
three divisions, headed by Prince Edward, Major General Dundas,
and Colonel Symes; to each of which was attached a part of the
Naval battalion. The storm was most decisively conducted with the
bayonet, but, amidst the heat of the contest, a great part of the
garrison was put to the sword. Having thus obtained possession
of the quarter of Grande Terre, from the republicans also
abandoning Fort Louis, the town of Point a Petre, and the battery
upon the islet Ã  Couchon, the 43d Regiment was left at D'EpÃ©e, and
the rest of the forces were re-embarked. Two divisions of the
Army under Prince Edward, and Colonel Symes, were again landed
on the evening and morning of the 14th and 15th of April, at Petit
Bourg, who seized the evacuated redoubt of D'Arbond, carrying
Arret by assault, in which was involved the material post of Palmiste,
by day break of the 20th; while Major General Dundas, having
been put ashore near the town of Basseterre, led his division against
Morne Magdaline, which he also gained.</p>

<p>General Collot being now cooped up within the town, and Fort
Charles, both of which were commanded by the heights in possession
of the British, he proposed terms for the surrender of Guadaloupe,
which were discussed, and subscribed.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Grey says, "that to the unanimity and extraordinary
exertions of the Navy and Army, under fatigues never exceeded,
his Majesty and their Country, are indebted for the rapid success in
extending the British Empire, by adding to it the valuable islands
of Martinique, St. Lucia, Guadaloupe, the Saintes, Marigalante,
and Descada." Sir John Jervis remarked, "that the unabated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
exertions of the Officers and men, <i>under his command</i>, could
never be surpassed, and that keeping constant pace with the troops
no difficulty or danger arrested, for an instant, their career of
glory."</p>

<p>A kind of forlorn detachment from France, which escaped all our
cruizers, achieved the recovery of Guadaloupe, after a series of hardy
contests, in which the Marines bore a part&mdash;Lieutenant John Mercer,
of my corps, was wounded in one of them, and became a victim
to fever, lamented by his friends, and his corps. Fruitless would
have been all the enemy's efforts, if fascinating liberty had not
erected her standard, whither numbers repaired, in the sanguine hope
of sharing in her gifts.</p>

<p>The 1st of June, 1794, presents one of the best fought actions that
appears on our Naval records. France had continued to molest our
commerce by her cruizing squadrons, but her internal necessities,
during this year of general scarcity, obliged her to concentrate her
ships, and, with all her united forces, to cover the safety of an
immense convoy from America. This was the main object, for which
nothing too much could be risqued.</p>

<p>From the instances of defection which had so often occurred in
her military leaders, that republic, jealous of its baneful extension,
combined Mons. St. Andre, an approved democrat, in the public
character of a Commissioner, with their Chief Vice Admiral Villaret
Joyeuse, on board the Montagne.</p>

<p>During three preceding days the fleets were in sight, two partial
affairs took place, and some very able manÅuvring. The wind having
been gained by Lord Howe, on the evening of the 31st of May, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
seven in the morning of the following day, he bore up to battle,
while the French coolly awaited his approach to so close a distance
that little more than an hour decided the victory. The republican
Chief gave the first example of flight, in which St. Andre, doubtless,
coalesced, in spite of all his popular enthusiasm. Seven captured
ships were amongst the fruits of that glorious day, which enervated all
the subsequent exertions of a vindictive foe, during the war.</p>

<p>Many of the fleet having been supplied with acting Marines, from
different regiments, the loss which befell our establishment was, on
that account, proportionally less. Captains (now. Colonel) Smith,
and C. Money, besides Lieutenant S. Mitchell, were among the
wounded, and comprized the total of our casualties in Officers.</p>

<p>The carnage amongst the French was dreadful, and in the ships
alone that were taken, it far exceeded the whole sustained by the
British fleet.</p>

<p>The united thanks of a grateful Country were conveyed to the
Officers, Seamen, and Marines, for their faithful services on this
proud day.</p>

<p>Few single actions appear on the face of this year. One which
was fought betwixt the Artois and La Revolutionaire French frigate,
did honor to Captain Nagle in achieving her capture; but it deprived
his King of a brave and good soldier, his family of a promising
member, and his corps of one of its most shining ornaments, in
Lieut. Peter Craigie, of Marines, who was severely wounded, and
died soon after amputation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XL" id="CHAP_XL"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XL.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">F</span>ifteen thousand Marines were voted for the service of
1795.</p>

<p>In consequence of the reverses of France at Toulon, and in the
battle of the 1st of June, her commerce was neglected, and her
Sailors became dispirited. Limiting nearly the whole of her energies
to one element, she was thus enabled in every quarter, to pour from
her frontiers a host of Soldiers and of Conquerors.</p>

<p>Holland, hitherto our ally, was over-run by her legions, who,
wherever they directed their steps, found the success of their arms
already ensured by the delusive power of their principles. Although,
in reality, a province, still a shew of acknowledged independence
was maintained, and the Dutch were admitted as principals in a
treaty of alliance which was concluded between the two republics.
Thus fraternized, Great Britain had to reckon a new and decided
enemy in a recent friend.</p>

<p>Accordingly, orders were issued in February 1795, for the detention
of vessels and property belonging to the subjects of Holland, an
expedition was framed against the Cape of Good Hope, and an
authority to subdue her settlements in the East, were transmitted to
our Commanders in that quarter of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>In those distant services the Corps of Marines bore a partial, but
an active share.</p>

<p>The attempt against the Cape was entrusted to the immediate
conduct of Sir George Elphinstone and Major General Craig, who
arrived in Simon's Bay early in July. A fruitless summons to surrender
it having been forwarded to its Governor, a debarkation of
450 of the 78th Regiment, and 350 Marines, under Major, now
Colonel Hill, was effected upon the 14th, in time to save that town
from devoted destruction.</p>

<p>Our troops had been expressly restrained from hostility against
the Dutch forces, but such was their conduct that it soon provoked
retaliation. It being necessary to dislodge them from the strong post of
Mysenburgh, which was fortified with heavy guns, and secured from
approach both by land and sea, by a steep mountain on the right,
and shallow water, constantly agitated by surf, on its left, 800
Seamen were landed under the Captains Spranger and Hardy, which
constituted a total strength of 1600 men. As they were without
cannon, the whole awaited the fortune of a wind that would allow
the ships of war to unite in the attack. This occurred on the 7th
of August, when Commodore Blankett got under weigh with the
America, Stately, Echo, and Rattlesnake; while General Craig
advanced with his little army. So judicious was the Naval disposition,
that the Dutch were driven by the fire of those ships, and
some launches armed with carronades, from one post to another,
which the troops successively occupied.</p>

<p>Retiring to a ridge of rocky heights beyond their camp, which
they had abandoned, the enemy were very spiritedly assaulted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Major Moneypenny, at the head of the advanced guard, supported
by the whole of the gallant 78th. Although seconded by some
heavy guns that over-awed it from across the lagoon towards Cape-town,
and possessing a hold almost impregnable from its situation,
they were still forced from it, after a contest which closed only with
the day. In the course of it, the Dutch left behind them some
artillery, which were drilled, and once more rendered serviceable
by Lieutenant Coffin and his company of pikemen, from the
Rattlesnake.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th of August, the enemy having drawn
their whole force from Cape-town, aimed it to recover the posts
they had lost. Observing, however, the strength of the British
positions, they desisted from any attempt, and the day was chiefly
spent in skirmishing with the 1st battalion of Seamen, under Captain
Hardy, and the Marines under Major Hill, who had passed the
lagoon. General Craig says, that both Corps were distinguished
throughout by regularity in manÅuvre, and the most steady resolution.
Major Hill was very ably assisted by the valuable advice
of Captain, now Lieut. Colonel Sir John Douglas, during the whole
of these fatiguing and combined duties.</p>

<p>A small reinforcement arrived on the 9th from St. Helena, but
the pressures of the army daily increased to such a degree, that it
became expedient, in order to alleviate them, to risque the storm of
one of the enemy's principal out-posts on the 27th of August, which
unfortunately failed. So critically were matters circumstanced, that
it was determined between the Commanders in Chief to try the
fortune of another assault in six days, if Sir Allured Clarke should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
not appear with the expected reinforcements. The Dutch had
resolved, however, to anticipate this issue, which was, in event, to
decide the fate of the Colony.</p>

<p>A disastrous affair on the 1st of September, in which the picquet
was driven in with loss, and Major Moneypenny most severely
wounded, encouraged them to this daring effort on the 3d. With a
train of eighteen field-pieces, and all the strength they could muster,
they appeared after break of day, but were stayed in their progress
by the signal for a fleet having hove in sight.</p>

<p>On the 4th, Major General Craig resigned the command to Sir
Allured Clarke, not without expressing his high sense of the animated
exertions of <i>all</i>, in the face of a superior enemy, as well as for
their cheerful resignation under the greatest hardships and fatigues.</p>

<p>From the powerful aids which had arrived, matters were pushed
on most briskly, and the Army moved against the post of Wyneberg
on the 14th. Here the Dutch demonstrated a shew of resistance;
but Commodore Blanket appearing in Table Bay with three ships,
in order to create a diversion, the enemy retreated, and early on the
morning of the 16th, proposed terms of surrender. By these, the
whole settlement was added to the British dominions.</p>

<p>Sir Allured Clarke united his cordial testimony with that of Sir
George Elphinstone, of the very meritorious conduct of the Officers,
Seamen, and Marines of the squadron, during a tedious service of
labour and even privation of necessary food. Only nine Marines were
wounded throughout.</p>

<p>In the East, the Islands of Ceylon and Manar, the Peninsula of
Malacca, Cochin, a seaport on the coast of Malabar, and, in fine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
most of the valuable settlements of the Dutch in Hindostan, fell
successively under the combined efforts of our Naval and Military
forces; in all of which, however, intrigue was more conspicuous than
active hostility.</p>

<p>It falls not within my scope to enlarge upon the many disastrous
events that took place in the West. There Victor Hughes, a man of
the most consummate talents, but which were stained by inhumanity,
acted both as the agent and the organ of republican France. He perfectly
assimilated himself to the temper of his employers; recognizing
only the rules of expediency, he was ever the ready advocate for the
most sanguinary works, and felt not the controul of principle where
it opposed his interests. His incendiary attempts will long be
reviewed with horror by those islands which were the theatres of his
plots.</p>

<p>This year abounded with Naval achievements.&mdash;In the Mediterranean
the French suffered a defeat, on the 8th of March, from
an inferior force, when on their way to recover Corsica. Admiral
Hotham's loss, in killed and wounded, upon this partial occasion,
was 315 Seamen and Marines.</p>

<p>Another action was fought on the 12th of July, which terminated
in the capture of one ship. Captains Towry and Middleton, the
Seamen and Marines of the Dido and Lowestoffe, were eminently
noticed for their gallantry in a successful contest with two of the
heaviest frigates from France, which terminated in the surrender of
one; while the other found refuge in flight.</p>

<p>On the coast of America the Hon. Captain Cochrane, with
Captain Beresford, were equally conspicuous in subduing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
superior antagonists; in which the former says, that the carronades
on the quarter deck of the Thetis, were very ably served by Lieut.
(afterward Captain) Paul Crebbin, and the Marines under his
command.</p>

<p>The masterly retreat of Vice-Admiral Cornwallis, in the face of an
enemy nearly thrice his force, exhibited such a display of cool valour,
as not to produce a parallel upon our annals. The energies of his pen
bespoke the feelings of his invincible mind; and although the merit
was exclusively his own, yet he generously shared it amongst his
faithful associates, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">"Royal Sovereign, June 18, 1795.</p>

<p>"Vice Admiral Cornwallis returns his sincere thanks to the
Captains, Officers, Seamen, and Marines of the Fleet under his
orders, for their steady and gallant conduct in the presence of the
French Fleet yesterday; which firmness, he has no doubt,
deterred the enemy from making a more serious attack. It would
give the Vice Admiral pleasure to put the whole of their exertions
in effect by meeting a more equal force, when the Country would
receive advantage, as it now does honour, from the spirit so truly
manifested by its brave men."</p>

<p>This gratifying tribute was followed up to each, by the most
precious tender which can be offered to a Briton&mdash;that of the
legislative thanks of his Country.</p>

<p>The Marine Soldier can often be retraced upon those proud
records.</p>

<p>It was reserved for Lord Bridport to convince the enemy of the
decisive weight of an equal force. On the 23d of June they owed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the salvation of all their Fleet to their formidable batteries, and
the strong Naval port of L'Orient. Lieut. William Jephcote, of
Marines, fell upon that day, which augmented our Fleet with three
sail of the line.</p>

<p>The engagement betwixt La Blanche, Captain Faulkner, and
the French frigate La Pique, fought early in 1795, off the island of
Guadaloupe, affords a lasting test of the superiority of English
discipline and courage. While our loss was confined to 29 killed
and wounded, that of the republicans exceeded a total of 212.
After exhibiting every quality of a judicious and brave Officer,
Captain Faulkner was shot through the heart, who left not behind
him a brighter example of true heroism.</p>

<p>The Marines of La Blanche behaved nobly, and maintained a
constant fire under Lieut. Richardson, who, with Serjeant George
Dice, did honour to their Corps.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">E</span>ighteen thousand Marines was the establishment of 1796.</p>

<p>The extensive and lamentable casualties which had befallen our
troops in the West Indies, with the enterprizing successes of Victor
Hughes, demanded auxiliary aids from Europe, not only to remedy
misfortunes, but to fill up their exhausted ranks.</p>

<p>After a train of unprecedented bad weather, which was combated
by Rear Admiral Christian with an uncommon perseverance, this
squadron and army, under Sir Ralph Abercromby, reached Barbadoes
early in 1796. An expedition was instantly undertaken against the
Dutch settlements in Guiana, to which Demerara, with Issequibo,
capitulated on the 22d of April, as did Berbice on the 2d of May,
without resistance.</p>

<p>The first object of the main Army was against St. Lucia, upon
which island, a debarkation was made on the 27th of April.
A series of attacks took place against the enemy's posts, in which
Brigadier General Moore, and the 27th Regiment, were particularly
noticed.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May 800 Seamen and 320 Marines were landed,
who co-operated on shore with much credit, until the total subjection
of St. Lucia, upon the 26th. I cannot express their good
conduct in stronger terms, than in these which proceeded from Sir
Ralph Abercromby, in General Orders of May 27th:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"During the services which have been carried on in the island
of St, Lucia, all the courage and every exertion of the Army,
would have proved ineffectual, if Rear Admiral Sir H. C.
Christian, and the Royal Navy, had not stepped forward with
the alacrity which had been so conspicuous in forwarding the
most arduous part of the public service; to their skill and unremitting
labour is, in a great measure, owing the success which
has attended his Majesty's arms. It will afford the Commander
in Chief the greatest satisfaction to be able to lay before his
Majesty the eminent services which have, on this occasion, been
performed by the Royal Navy; and Admiral Sir H. C. Christian
will confer a particular obligation on Lieut. General Sir R.
Abercromby and the Army at large, if he will communicate to
the Royal Navy, and particularly to Captains Lane, Ryves, and
Stephenson, and the other Officers who acted on shore; and to
the Corps of Marines, the great obligation which they consider
themselves under to them.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">T. Busby</span>, Adjutant General."</p>

<p>St. Vincents and Grenada, disorganized by the bustling Victor
Hughes, were again restored to order; in effecting which objects,
the Marines were also auxiliary, in union with their brethren of
the Navy.</p>

<p>Early in this year the Dutch possessions of Amboyna and Banda
were taken by the exertions of the squadron under Admiral Rainier,
and the reduction of Columbo in the isle of Ceylon, with an immense
booty, also occurred, by the joint forces under Colonel J. Stuart, and
Captain Gardner of the Heroine. Although devoid of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
military interest, still those settlements were of high importance in a
commercial view, and I reflect with a mixture of pleasure and of
pride, upon every instance in which my Corps has been instrumental
in promoting the solid interests of their Country.</p>

<p>An expedition, that was destined for the recovery of the Cape
of Good Hope, under Admiral Lucas, became a prey to the active
vigilance of Sir George Elphinstone, who, with a cool judgment,
and anxious to spare the effusion of blood, proposed terms of surrendering
his squadron. By this exemplary address, eight ships of
war were gained without a shot, or the loss of a man.</p>

<p>The French settlement of Foul Point, on the island of Madagascar,
on the coast of Africa, was destroyed by the Seamen and
Marines of the Crescent, Brave, and Sphynx, in the month of
December.</p>

<p>Captain, now Lord Nelson, gave crouded displays of his zeal
and courage upon various services in the Mediterranean during this
year, by the cutting out some vessels from under the batteries
of Loano, the capture of a Spanish frigate in La Minerve, and
in obtaining possession of the Isle of Elba, without any loss.
Porto Ferrajo, afterwards noted for its distinguished defence by
a few Marines and some mixed troops, likewise capitulated to
him, on the Captain, of 74 guns, having been placed against the
grand Bastion.</p>

<p>The able valour of Captain Macnamara, of the Southampton,
in boarding and bringing off, from under a heavy fire of the batteries
on Porquerollos, one of the Hieres islands, the corvette Utile, is
beyond praise. Lieut. Lydiard behaved most spiritedly, and William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Oirton, private Marine, was the only man killed on this brilliant
service.</p>

<p>The conduct of Captain Bowen, his Seamen and Marines, in
the Terpsichore, was twice most gallantly evinced by the capture
of El Mahonesa and La Vertale, in the months of October and
December.</p>

<p>Returning homewards, the Naval incidents of the year were
repeated and animated.</p>

<p>On the 17th of March, Sir Sidney Smith, with that intrepidity
in hazard so natural to him, destroyed a small convoy within the
port of Herqui; which was not accomplished however, without
landing some Seamen, under Lieut. Pine, and the Marines of the
Diamond, under Lieut. Carter, who, in spite of a body of troops,
pushed ashore, climbed the precipice in front of their batteries, and
re-embarked, after having spiked the guns. Lieut. Pine was
wounded, and Lieut. Carter mortally, of which he soon died, leaving
behind him the merited character of a most excellent Officer and
amiable man.</p>

<p>On the 20th, Sir John Warren, with his little squadron, engaged
a very superior force, taking one frigate and four of a convoy.</p>

<p>Lieut. Williams, of Marines, appears mentioned by Sir Edward
Pellew as having rendered essential service on board the Indefatigable,
in capturing La Virginie upon the 21st of April.</p>

<p>The fortunate contest between the Unicorn, Captain Sir Thomas
Williams, and La Tribune, began under an obvious disadvantage, and
while it has fully established the fame of that Officer, it was likewise
most honourable to Lieut. Hart of my Corps. The Seamen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Marines of La Margaretta were also much distinguished in Captain
Martin's official dispatch, announcing the capture of La Tamise.</p>

<p>Captain Trollope, in the Glatton, of 54, armed with heavy
carronades, stands most highly on the records of this year, by his
having encountered and beat a squadron carrying upwards of 200
guns, and in every respect nearly thrice his force. While the circumstances
of the battle reflect a lustre upon all who fought, the
unsubdued spirit of Captain Strangeways, of Marines, was truly
heroic, and demands the grateful sympathy of his Country and
his Corps. After having received a ball in his thigh, he was
necessarily carried below, and on a tourniquet having been applied
by the Surgeon, he insisted upon going again to his quarters,
where he continued to animate his men until he fainted from loss of
blood, when Captain Trollope was obliged to interpose his authority
for his removal from danger. He afterwards fevered and died,
forsaking by destiny a distressed widow and family to deplore his
fall, to the tutelar care of Providence and the British nation.
William Hall, Corporal of Marines, was, besides, the only one
wounded in this memorable action.</p>

<p>Sir John Warren, by his reiterated exploits through the year, has
very meritedly founded a name for spirit and zeal.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1796 the French fleet put to sea from
Brest, with the direct aim of invading the sister kingdom of Ireland.
To it an army of 15,000 men was united under General Hoche.
Heaven again stepped forth to thwart their schemes, whose elementary
agents were employed to overthrow them. Scarcely had they
set sail, when the winds began to blow with violence, which burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
into a storm after gaining sight of the wished for land. Their
armament was finally scattered, and while a part of it, was buried
in the ocean, others were doomed to augment the British Navy, and
the remains to hasten back, in disappointment and in terror, towards
their own ports.</p>

<p>Judging, from external evidences, their reception would have been
worthy of Irishmen, had their invaders reached their shores.</p>

<p>Patriotism shone forth in every rank of society, and one godlike
churchman<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> exerted those powerful energies, which must always be
attached to every reputable member of his honorable calling, in
keeping alive the sacred flame.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">S</span>pain having become a compulsory ally of France, during the last
year, an expedition took place against the valuable island of Trinidad,
on the North East coast of Terra Firma, in South America, which
surrendered after a very trifling resistance, to the joint forces under
Sir Ralph Abercrombie and Rear Admiral Hervey. Blended with
this capture, were 4 sail of the line and one frigate, which offered no
opposition to our fleet, but were destroyed by the enemy, excepting
the St. Damaso of 70 guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Another but less fortunate attempt was made upon Porto Rico,
but it was relinquished from the inadequacy of means to carry it, after
some loss. On both occasions the Marines were placed in readiness
to act, but were not required to land.</p>

<p>Sir John Jervis (now Earl St. Vincent) had the honourable
distinction of standing foremost in the list of Naval Heroes, who,
unappalled by very superior numbers, dashed at every thing. His
masterly manÅuvres, upon the 14th of February, rendered this
encouraging advantage unavailing to the Spanish Fleet, which, by a
bold and decisive push, he separated, and defeated. This immortal
action was not only crowned with the glory of capturing 4 sail of the
line, but it had also its influence upon the spirits of our enemy, in
every subsequent combat on the sea. An uncommon display of
personal intrepidity was evinced by Commodore Nelson, Captain
Miller, and Lieutenant (afterwards Captain) Berry, who at the head
of the boarders from his Majesty's ship Captain, assaulted and carried,
sword in hand, the San Joseff and St. Nicholas. The battle raged
from 10 in the morning, until the close of day, which screened this
powerful armament from destruction. Major William Norris, Lieut.
G. A. Livingstone, and Serjeant Watson, of Marines, finished their
lives, and 6 privates were killed, besides 21 wounded, in a contest
where all were distinguished. The Legislative thanks were bestowed
upon every class of our victorious fleet, and all these honours which a
grateful Country could give, were conferred upon her meritorious
servants. The port of Cadiz was afterwards most effectually
blockaded, and was twice bombarded, in one of which Captain John
Oldfield, of Marines, was wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>No war, in which England was ever engaged, has produced so
many high examples of subordinate enterprize, as that of which I
treat. Like the gymnastick games, it is a spirit which should always
be kept up, and although similar to petty skirmishing, it is as a drop
in the bucket in the scale of importance, it still has a tendency to
animate an emulous zeal, and the love of glory. It is the school
in which greater deeds are taught, and to which all should be
invited.</p>

<p>While I thus appear the humble advocate in recommending an
ardency for early achievement, I would at the same time urge a
gradation of recompence, or of honorary grants, suited to the feelings
of every description of its agents. These have been of old standing,
and have undergone many a change, alternately adapted to the
fluctuating manners of society. Many a useful hint might be gleaned
from the institutions of the Greeks and the Romans, and as <i>human
nature never alters</i>, they might well be applied to ourselves. The
French have studied and practised these doctrines with success.
Louis the 11th rewarded the prowess and bravery of one of his soldiers,
Launay Morvillier, by publicly taking the collar of a military order,
from his own neck, and putting it on his. Under the republican
system, this has been invariably observed, towards the meanest, by
every convention, of whatever stuff it has been composed, and it has
been one of the engines by which their numerous armies have been
worked into enthusiasm. Medals, descriptive of those merits that
have acquired them, would be estimable even to the poor man.
While they adorned the cottage, they would also be viewed by every
one of its tenants as monumental emblems of loyal valour; a title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
which each of its members would not only be loth to forfeit, but
inclined to rival.</p>

<p>These remarks are introductory to one of the many exploits by
which this contest was marked.</p>

<p>The boats of the Lively and La Minerve under Lieut. Hardy, in
which, Lieut. Bulkeley, of Marines, most handsomely volunteered,
boarded, and carried La Mutine brig of 12 six pounders and 2 thirty-six
pound corronades, having 113 men, in the bay of Sancta Cruz,
amidst the fire of all the Spanish batteries, and a sharp discharge from
the French corvette. Only 15 were wounded in this hot affair.
Lieut. Hardy was deservedly promoted, but his brave companions
have no traces of the deed, but in their own minds.</p>

<p>An unsuccessful essay upon Teneriffe on the 25th of July, under
Commodore Nelson, fraught with many feats of unsurpassed bravery,
ended in the re-embarkation of the seamen and Marines, by consent
of the enemy, who were threatened by Captain Trowbridge, with
the vengeance of our squadron, in the event of molestation. Owing
to the judicious proposals made by that excellent Officer, boats were
supplied by the Spanish Governor, to remedy the loss of our own from
the violence of the surf; the wounded were kindly taken into the
hospitals, and that generous foe even tendered such refreshments as his
invaders might request. Commodore Nelson here lost his arm, which
happily did not deprive his Country of the services of one of its most
valuable subjects.</p>

<p>Lieut. Robinson and Basham, and 16 of my corps fell, 15 were
wounded, and 102 Seamen and Marines were drowned or missing.
Although the event was unpropitious, still our arms were not sullied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Partaking of the diabolical spirit of the times, one of the most
daring and sanguinary mutinies broke out in the Hermione, on the
22d of September, that ever disgraced the Christian world. After the
most shocking barbarities exercised upon Captain Pigot, the Officers,
Marines, and loyal Seamen, who were unsuspicious of their hellish
plot, they carried the ship into the Spanish port of La Guira, whose
Governor most ingloriously refused to give her up.</p>

<p>An avenging power, in numberless examples, too striking to be
overlooked, has followed those traitorous murderers, and has
vindicated the justice of his injured laws. Contempt embittered by
remorse have been the inseparable companions of all those guilty
individuals. Driven from the shores where they sanguinely
anticipated nothing but recompence and applause, many of those
wretched outcasts, by retracing their steps towards their native land,
have met a certain and disgraceful doom, others unable to bear the
stings of a wounded conscience, and abhorring existence, have
precipitated their own dissolution, while the remains of those
unhappy wanderers still throw a wishful eye from, their lurking spots,
back on the soil which gave them birth, but where a vigilant Police,
that vicegerent of heaven's purposes, is ever awake to their crimes.
Even the very ship which was the theatre of their lawless outrage,
has also been involved in their accursed destinies, for she was sometime
after gallantly cut out of Porto Cavallo, by Sir Edward Hamilton,
at the head of a body of Seamen and Marines from the Surprize,
although protected by 200 heavy cannon, and under circumstances
of incredible carnage, with the loss of only one Englishman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>A peculiar spirit of activity seemed to pervade our squadron upon
the Jamaica station, during the year 1797. Above 60 vessels of
different descriptions were taken or destroyed, under batteries where
they rode in confident security, but which were uniformly inadequate
to shelter them from determined valour. The zeal and directing
genius of Captains W. H. Ricketts, and the unfortunate Pigot, were
always well seconded by their Officers, their Sailors and Marines.</p>

<p>At the eventful period when Britain was contending for the
general liberties of mankind against the most vindictive and powerful
enemies she had ever encountered, when our islands were menaced
with invasion, and treason stalked throughout our streets, she
suddenly found herself deserted by her long tried and guardian fleets.</p>

<p>The turbulent demon first appeared in the garb of justice, but
after having gained its ends, he soon threw away the mask which
covered his mutinous and corrupt heart. Those liberal concessions
made by a considerate and grateful Country, appeared to stimulate,
instead of suppressing revolt, and its contaminating principles diffused
themselves over every quarter of the world.</p>

<p>Many were the individual instances of fidelity in my corps, at
this awful crisis. Many were the gallant fellows in it who preferred
the honorable distinction of allegiance to their King, to the mercenary
attainments of self interest. The partial support of the party of
Marines on board the London, given to Admiral Colpoys and his
Officers, at a time when they were surrounded by thousands of
disaffected comrades, afforded a faint display of what would have
been their general energies had such been called forth. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
indeed overpowered by numbers, after a contest, in which Lieutenant
(now Captain) W. Sims was severely wounded. The loyal conduct
of Serjeant Sweet, on board the Pompee, was evident to the members
of a Court Martial which sat upon the trial of some misguided
mutineers of that ship.</p>

<p>An instance of true heroism appeared in Charles Cubitt, private
Marine, (in the Royal Sovereign I think,) who, after having been
stabbed in the belly, by a Sailor, with a pike, pursued him with a
loaded musket at his ear, but on the fellow begging for life, he
nobly spared him.</p>

<p>The steady faithfulness of all those Marine Soldiers who had
served during the American war, and had survived the heavy
reduction at its close, was uniformly conspicuous. At the outset of
these lamentable events, an unshaken resolve to stand or fall with
their Officers, inspired every breast, which, had it been accepted,
might have led to the sacrifice of those brave men who would have
been opposed to uneven numbers, in the Seamen and many of their
fellows, whom public emergency had embarked, untrained even to
the common duties of their profession, and unhabituated to that strict
obedience, which is the essence of every military virtue. Unconscious
of that dignity which belongs to his character, the raw recruit
readily gives in to any scheme urged by the designing; of which
there were too many drawn from the dregs of society, amongst those
provincial conscripts who had previously been levied at the most
enormous bounties, to man the fleet.</p>

<p>This fiendly spirit soon found its way to the Mediterranean,
where all the achievements of Earl St. Vincent's life were yet, I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
say, surpassed, by the evidences of that manly vigour with which
he subdued it. In this, his Lordship was zealously seconded by all
the Officers and the Marines of his fleet, and by one uniform system of
subordination which emanated from his high example. The conduct
of Admiral Duncan, at Yarmouth, and Admiral Pringle, at the Cape
of Good Hope, was alike energetic.</p>

<p>Subsequent events have shewn that this flame was only stifled,
but not extinguished, and it would have yielded me the highest
gratification to have here bidden an adieu to the hateful topic.</p>

<p>It is an occasion, worthy of the gratitude of Britons, to notice the
relative situations of our republican foes at this alarming juncture.
France would have eagerly embraced such an hour of calamity to
consummate her ambitious views upon our happy Country, but she
was paralyzed by similar principles in her own Navy, while the
meditated expedition against Ireland, was detained in the ports of
Holland by unabating and contrary winds.</p>

<p>This year was remarkable by an increase of pay to his Majesty's
subaltern Officers, the abolition of arrears to them, to Captains of
the Army, as well as Marines, besides a very handsome addition to the
wages of Seamen, and to inferiors in all the other departments of our
military forces. That liberal allowance of provisions which was also
granted to the Sailors and Marines of the fleet, has rendered their
situations truly enviable, as upon a general aggregate they are
more than they can possibly consume. The overplus being converted
into money is nearly adequate to the purchase of those
cordials of which they stand in need, and, in consequence, a prudent
man is under little necessity to encroach upon his pecuniary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
gains. No class of his Majesty's servants is more independent, or
might be more happy.</p>

<p>The gallantry of our Navy in the face of an enemy, notwithstanding
these outrageous scenes, was uniformly apparent. That
expert Seaman and intrepid Officer, Sir Edward Pellew, stands first
on the list, accompanied by his brave supporter Captain R. C.
Reynolds, of the Amazon, who nobly seconded the Indefatigable, in
a contest, with but few intervals, of ten hours. Their opponent, Les
Droits de L'Homme, of 74 guns, had been attached to the squadron
destined for Ireland, and was on her return to France when attacked
by those daring Officers. She had 1600 men on board, by which she
fought her cannon on both sides, and thus enjoyed her great superiority.
The winds blew a storm, and all their animosities subsided
at last in the predominant duty of self-preservation; for a glimpse of
the moon providentially penetrating the sullen clouds, pointed out
the breakers on a near shore, and the gloomy presage of instantaneous
destruction. They were fatal to the unhappy Frenchman, who
merited a better doom, as well as to the Amazon, after all her
efforts. Sir Edward Pellew expressed his grateful feelings to Lieuts.
O'Connor and Wilson, of Marines, for their conduct under these
trying occasions.</p>

<p>A disastrous fate seems to have always pursued every modern aim
at the conquest of our isles. A petty attempt on Wales, by means
of a set of wretched criminals, terminated with their immediate
surrender to Lord Cawdor; and the capture of the frigates that had
transported them, by Sir H. Neal and Captain J. Cooke, of the St.
Fiorenzo and Nymphe, in sight of their own fleet in the road of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Brest. Lieut. (afterwards Capt.) Carruthers, who was subsequently
drowned in the Invincible, and Lieut. Campbell, of Marines, were
distinguished in this spirited affair.</p>

<p>Sir John Warren and his squadron were highly active in annoying
the enemy's Naval force and coasting trade during this year.</p>

<p>It is needless to enlarge upon the merits of the brilliant victory
of the 11th of October, achieved under the most hazardous circumstances,
and signally productive of the most important consequences.
The very modest recital of Admiral, now Lord Duncan, of the
proceedings of that day, adds a lustre to his well-earned glory.
Long baulked in the hopes of meeting his cautious enemy, no wonder
his joy kept pace with his zeal to close with them when he had them
in his power. The Dutch Marine has not yet recovered the blow,
and the services of the North Sea fleet have, experimentally,
transcended in their effects to enervate the Naval exertions of that
province of France, in two wars.</p>

<p>During the very able and vigilant administration of Earl Spencer,
reward was the rapid follower of desert, and the British Commander,
after not many hours absence from his Country, found himself, on
return to it, elevated, from a commoner, to a Peer of the Realm.
A suitable tribute was bestowed upon his brave second Vice Admiral,
now Sir Richard Onslow, and Captain H. Trollope, who was bearer
of the glad tidings, as well as W. G. Fairfax, the Admiral's Captain;
both of whom were created Knights Banneret<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, by a benevolent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>and grateful Sovereign. The Thanks of the Nation were also conveyed
to the Officers, Seamen, and Marines, through its representatives.</p>

<p>The generous contributions of the patriotic and the wealthy of
our land, were likewise extended to many a disconsolate widow, a
fatherless offspring, and a helpless orphan. The sufferings of the
wounded and indigent Officer too were alleviated by public kindness,
which sought for objects upon which to exercise its benevolence
amongst the lowest ranks of those brave defenders. How criminal it
is in any to violate the duties of fidelity to such a Country!</p>

<p>In this well-fought battle 751 Seamen and Marines were killed
and wounded, amongst the latter of which were numbered Captains
Cuthbert and Cassel, Lieuts. Chambers, Smith, Walker, Charles
Rea, and Sandys.</p>

<p>A dash at the Brutus, of 74 guns, by Sir Thomas Williams,
after the battle, was ineffectual; but did honour to himself, his
Officers, Seamen, and Marines, in the Endymion.</p>

<p>The capture of La Nereide, by Captain, now Sir Robert
Barlow, in a night action, displayed the courage and talents of
that Officer, and was highly honourable to Lieut. Stewart and his
detachment.</p>

<p>On the 19th of December, one of the most delightful scenes ever
witnessed in the metropolis of any Empire, was exhibited in ours.
It was the procession of the best of Kings, his amiable consort, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
branch of the Royal Family, and the representatives of the greatest
Nation on earth, towards the altars of their God. Never did prayers
ascend on high with a greater fervor of devotion, which was
heightened by every surrounding object. The occasion was well
calculated to convert the heedless infidel, and to excite a military
enthusiasm <i>not</i> to be easily effaced.</p>

<p>Bodies of Marines, drawn from Portsmouth and from Chatham,
chiefly formed from those who had so often contributed to the Naval
victories of the State, in union with their brethren the Seamen, were
allotted for the protection of these trophies which their valour had conquered,
and what moved along towards the spot, where all were to
pour forth their solemn thanksgivings. Their Majesties were greeted
on the way by thousands of their affectionate subjects, and the Prime
Minister of the day, who had presided over the Councils of his
Country with such ability during its unexampled difficulties, was
received with that unconstrained applause, which attested that
Englishmen knew how to appreciate his transcendent virtues.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>wenty thousand Marines constituted the force of 1798.</p>

<p>No occurrences worthy of particular remark happened this year
either in Asia or America; but few opportunities presented to signalize
our Navy, and these were of an inferior rate, while the
diminished territory of our enemies in both, left but a limited range
for further conquest.</p>

<p>The possession of Port-au-Prince, and its dependencies in the
island of St. Domingo was relinquished, after a struggle truly
honourable to our soldiery and squadrons; but in which the loss of
many lives, and an immense expenditure, were unhappily involved.</p>

<p>It is to the shores of the Mediterranean and the coasts of Africa,
the eye is called to witness scenes of insatiable ambition, but of
unrivalled glory.</p>

<p>At this era France had overcome her numerous foes by the
enchantments of her principles, the charms of her gold, or the terror
of her arms. Hitherto she had almost supported her immense armies
within those provinces she had subdued, or the countries she had
invaded. Peace shut the channel of such resources, as there were
now but scanty gleanings from an unabating rapacity, which had
desolated every soil that had been visited by her citizens.</p>

<p>An army, long inured to plunder and to victory, became a
natural object of jealousy within the bosom of their Country. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
enemy, manly in politics, unexhausted in wealth, and unbended in
attitude, continued to oppose this insinuating monster, too long arrayed
in the borrowed garb of freedom. The riches of our island, and the
virtues of its natives, had each their effects in stimulating this mass
of men to farther dangers, and in attracting the hatred of a Government,
which, consciously, derived all its temporary energies from that
infidelity to God, and annihilation of every moral principle which,
by pervading France, had reconciled Frenchmen to the commission
of any act.</p>

<p>The title of "Invading Army of England" was bestowed upon
these extended corps, who were diverted from employing their
speculative ideas as subjects, by pointing out to them future duties
as soldiers. We may judge of this mighty force when we reflect
that its right wing alone, posted on the coasts of the Mediterranean
exceeded 40,000. At the head of it was Buonaparte, denominated
the Conqueror of Italy, and deservedly standing high as a General;
but his exploits had rendered him an object of suspicion to the rulers
of France, who were well aware of his popularity amongst the
soldiery, and his thirst for power.</p>

<p>An expedition to Egypt, with a view to overthrow the British
power in the East, had long been a favourite scheme of the
Monarchy, and it was revived under the Republic, which was
anxious to get rid of its legionary troops. It was well suited to
the ambition of Buonaparte, and he was an admirable agent to
execute such faithless purposes.</p>

<p>My limits will not allow me to indulge in farther theories, nor
can I accompany him in his unprincipled progress. Malta, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
key to all his hopes, soon fell under his intrigues; after which
he proceeded, with an unexampled secrecy, to the friendly and
unsuspecting sea-coasts of the Turkish Empire. Alexandria and
Cairo became easy and alternate conquests to his delusive promises.
The covering fleet, under De Bruix, in the mean time
anchored, and formed into order of battle, in the Bay of Aboukir,
protected by flanking batteries, and seemingly impregnable by any
force.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Nelson, long distinguished for the most gallant
and active zeal, was destined to oppose this formidable combination,
and to achieve one of the most brilliant Naval victories that stands
upon the annals of the world. I will forbear to dwell on an event
which is so generally appreciated, and what must be immortal as
time itself.</p>

<p>Captain Faddy, of Marines, fell on the memorable 1st of August,
whose widow and family recognized a protector and a friend in
Lord Nelson.</p>

<p>Captains J. Cresswell, John Hopkins, and Lieut. John Jewell,
were wounded; 46 Marine Soldiers were killed, and 78 were
wounded.</p>

<p>As usual, the honorary and pecuniary gratitude of the Nation
was stretched forth to every rank amongst the conquerors, and its
Legislative Bodies conveyed their sense of such splendid deeds, in
adequate and animated terms, to all.</p>

<p>Upon the following day a general thanksgiving was offered up
to heaven, which made not a greater impression upon ourselves,
than on the captive Frenchmen, who could not but express their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
admiration of so solemn an assemblage, at a time of seeming confusion,
and when every heart felt all the elations of success.</p>

<p>The Admiral also tendered his acknowledgments to all the
Officers, Seamen, and Marines, for their gallant behaviour, and
for a victory that had been gained by their discipline and good
order.</p>

<p>No battle on the sea ever produced more signal consequences.&mdash;It
stimulated Austria to resume her arms, and aroused the effeminate
States of Italy to a sense of their glory and their danger.</p>

<p>Although eclipsed in comparison, still the subordinate Naval
transactions in the Mediterranean were guided by a similar spirit.
Lieut. Perry, of Marines, distinguished himself upon a voluntary
dash at the corvette Mendovi, which was carried by the boats of the
Flora, under a heavy fire from the batteries of Corigo, that brig,
and the vessels in the harbour. John Perks, private Marine, was
the only brave fellow killed in this daring attempt, and Lieut. Perry
was slightly wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Digby, and the crew of the Aurora, were likewise
noticed for a train of enterprize; and Captain Foote, with all his
coadjutors, in the Seahorse, by the capture of La Sensible French
frigate.</p>

<p>The action of Captain Manley Dixon, in the Lion, of 64, with
four heavy Spanish frigates, one of which he took, was a most
brilliant affair, in which all under his command were alike deserving.</p>

<p>The combat between Le Genereaux, of 74, full of men, and
the Leander, of 50, upon the 18th of August, though unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in its issue, was yet highly honourable to our arms, when the circumstance
of her diminished crew is considered. Captain Thompson,
whose conduct in the battle of the Nile had been most conspicuous,
says, that "his antagonist run the Leander on board the larboard
bow, with a view to carry her, and continued along-side for some
time; a most spirited and well-directed fire, however, from our
small party of Marines (commanded by a Serjeant) on the poop,
and from the quarter-deck, prevented the enemy from taking
advantage of his good fortune, and he was repulsed, in all his
efforts to make an impression on us."</p>

<p>The Leander, afterwards reduced to a wreck, surrendered to her
superior foe; but not without killing or wounding one-third of their
number. The brave Serjeant Dair and seven Marines were slain,
and nine wounded; being nearly a half of their little party.</p>

<p>The capture of La Legere gun-boat, by the Alemene, Captain
Hope, afforded a striking instance of intrepidity in James Harding,
Marine Drummer, and John Taylor, Seaman, on board the British
frigate. Although going through the water more than five miles an
hour, yet, observing a packet of dispatches to have been thrown
overboard from the republican vessel, they dashed into the sea and
recovered them, at the imminent risk of their lives; those fine
fellows were, however, picked up by a boat, and each of them was
rewarded by a pension of 20<i>l</i>. a year, from the Corporation of
London. The contents were of much importance, as being from
the National Convention to their General Buonaparte, in Egypt.
Harding afterwards shared upwards of 200<i>l</i>. from the galleons taken
on the 16th of October, by the Alemene and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>So sensible was the Common Council of London of their merits,
and so anxious to recompence them, that they made special enquiry,
through their clerk, to the Board of Admiralty, in order to ascertain
the circumstances and families of those brave men, and the
above annuity was consequent upon that investigation.</p>

<p>On the 28th of October the fortified island of Goza, about five
miles to the North-west of Malta, belonging to the Knights of
that Order, surrendered to Captain Ball, of the Alexander; when
Captain, now Major Cresswell, with a party of Marines, took
possession of it.</p>

<p>The detachments from the Leviathan and Centaur had the honour
of being attached to the Army, under General Stuart, to whom, and
the squadron under Commodore Duckworth, the important island of
Minorca capitulated, on the 15th of November, after a trifling
resistance, and without the loss of one British Soldier.</p>

<p>His Sicilian Majesty took refuge on board of Lord Nelson's ship,
and retired to Sicily on the 21st of December, as the French had
possessed themselves of Naples. It fell to the lot of a branch of my
Corps, under Lieut. Colonel Strickland, to be highly instrumental in
restoring that Prince to the Neapolitan throne, in a short but brilliant
campaign, during the summer of the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Few periods of our Naval history have presented so many
instances of achievement on the home station, as that under
discussion.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March a desperate action was fought between
the Mars and La Hercule, of nearly equal force, both ships touching
during the space of one hour and a half. English valour at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
prevailed, but with a heavy loss. Captain Alexander Hood, who
blended in himself all the talents and virtues of his ancestors,
fell in the moment of victory; and Captain Joseph White, of
Marines, shared his fate, while discharging the duty of a gallant
Officer.</p>

<p>Much do I lament in not being able to commemorate the <i>names</i>
of five brave privates of my Corps, who, with an habitual intrepidity,
attempted to board the enemy, but dropping into the sea, were
crushed between the sides of the contending ships.</p>

<p>The defence of the little islands of St. Marcou, against an
immense flotilla of the enemy, manned with nearly 8000 Soldiers, is
inferior to none of the many exploits of our arms. Garrisoned chiefly
by Marines, I am well assured that their cool courage on the 7th of
May was never surpassed, and it was indeed evidenced by a scene of
carnage amongst their enemies, while their own casualties were
limited to Thomas Hall, private, killed; Richard Dunn and Thomas
Williamson, privates, and Thomas Banks, Seaman, wounded. The
attack having been levelled against the westernmost island, although
both were in the line of shot, prevented any efforts on the part of
Lieut. Bourne, who commanded on the eastern battery. Much might
have been otherwise expected from the abilities of that Officer, and
the system of discipline he invariably maintained. He would have
also been well seconded by Lieut. Lawrence, of my Corps, whose
gallantry upon an ulterior occasion fully justifies my assertion.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the steadiness of Lieuts. Maughan and
Ensor, of Marines. It was worthy of the Country and the service,
whose honour was in their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant (now Captain) Charles P. Price also mentioned the
conduct of Serjeant Henderson, of the Royal Artillery, in handsome
terms. Indeed that body is outdone by none in the world, wherever
it is called forth.</p>

<p>The capture of La Seine, French frigate, on the 29th of June,
drew forth the encomiums of Captains Stirling and Milne, of the Jason
and Pique, upon the spirit of Lieutenants Symes and Macdonald. The
former of these amiable young men has now paid the debt of nature,
but he will long be remembered by his friends. Lieutenant Ross was
much distinguished in a very daring affair in the port of Corigiou,
upon the morning of the 4th of August. After having carried the
corvette Adventurier, a contrary wind sprung up, which exposed
her, nearly two hours, to the fire of all the batteries, working out in
a narrow passage which was at last effected. That Officer is also
now no more.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the boasts of invasion, still the French dared
not any thing upon a scale of consequence. A few frigates landed
General Humbert, who, with his followers, were made prisoners in
Ireland; but not without making a respectable opposition.</p>

<p>It was reserved for our naval bulwarks to render abortive another
attempt, and to give some creditable earnests of their Officers' talents
and courage. On the 12th of October, Le Hoche of 80, the frigates
Bellone, Coquille, and Ambuscade were taken by Sir John Warren's
squadron. The decisive spirit of that gallant and rising character
Captain Graham Moore, was fully shewn in the prompt attack of
La Resolue of 40 guns, and taking her before she could be supported
by her consort. They were both superior in force to the Melampus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
The conduct of Lieutenant Hole, and his party of Marines was
mentioned in gratifying terms.</p>

<p>On the 20th of October another action, alike brilliant, was fought
between the Fishguard, Captain Martin, and L'ImmortalitÃ©, which,
after a spirited contest of more than two hours, ended in the Frenchman's
surrender.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gerrard, of Marines, was wounded upon that occasion.
So uniformly respectable, was the course of that Officer's life, and so
creditable his services, that it may not be amiss to state here, a very
honorable testimony subsequently bestowed upon him, from the
Officers, Seamen, and Marines of the Fishguard. The gift of a
sabre and belt was accompanied to him, with the following very
flattering eulogium: "This sabre and belt are presented to 1st Lieut.
Gerrard, of Marines, by those who served with him on board
his Majesty's ship Fishguard, in memory of the action with
L'ImmortalitÃ©, the 20th October, 1798, the boarding expeditions
at the Saintes, Penmarks, Quimper, Noirmoutier, St. Matthew,
St. Andero, and Corrunna; on which he served as a volunteer,
and bore so distinguished a part." He has recently been appointed
to an Adjutancy at Plymouth vacated by the promotion of Captain
Perceval.</p>

<p>La Loire frigate was engaged by the Mermaid, of 32, Captain
Newman, who, after the most persevering courage, was obliged to
relinquish the unequal combat, which afforded an additional test of
the zealous intrepidity of Captain Durham, in the Anson, who,
although much disabled by the prevailing gales, attacked and carried
her after an hour and one quarter's dispute. First Lieut. W. A. Bell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of Marines, was wounded, and Captain Durham acknowledges the
services he derived from him, as well as Lieutenant Derring, who
superintended the carronades of the Anson, during the fight. The
privates James Cummings and Robert Dillon were also wounded.
Captain Countess, in the Ethalion, likewise took his bird.</p>

<p>By such successive exploits, was the invasion of Ireland averted,
and so important were they deemed by the Nation, that its public
thanks were expressed to Sir J. Warren, his Officers, Seamen, and
Marines.</p>

<p>An unfortunate meeting between the Ambuscade and La Bayonnaire,
of equal force, closed the transactions of 1798. So habituated
are Englishmen to conquer on the sea, that they never reckon upon
many accidents to which contests, on that element, are subject.
The courage of Captain Jenkins could not compensate for his want of
fortune. He and Lieutenant Sinclair, of Marines, were badly
wounded, before the colours were struck, and the enemy, for once,
successfully availed themselves of a panic, occasioned by the bursting
of a gun, to gain her by boarding.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>wenty thousand Marines formed the establishment of 1799.</p>

<p>An event truly brilliant in itself, and most important in its
results, claim a merited precedence in my narrative of the transactions
of this year. I mean, the noble defence of St. Jean d'Acre, in the
land of Palestine. Yielding to the habitual sentiments of my mind,
I am always led to exult in any occasion, upon which the energies
of the Soldier, but more especially of my corps, have been conducive
to the protection, or the aggrandisement of commerce. It constitutes
the very vitals of our Country, and demands the fostering care of
every member of it. The world is well apprized of the ambitious
views which directed the expedition of Bonaparte to Egypt. Although
his army had been cut off from all intercourse with France ever since
the decisive battle of Aboukir, still the inventive resources of his
genius had established within a few months, a little independent
Empire guided by social institutes, and a regulated police. Versatile
and accommodating in his principles, they always veered with his
interests, and he knew human nature too well not to make them
subservient to the religious prejudices of these superstitious natives,
over whom he had usurped a government. Wherever hostility
appeared, it was successively overcome, and his dominion over Lower
Egypt might be said to have been complete at the opening of 1799.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>This solid position, on the high road to our valuable possessions in
the East, soon awakened all the active jealousy of the British Nation.
Although secrecy had marked the steps of this unprincipled and
hypocritical crusader, still they were guessed at, and traced by an
enlightened Cabinet.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney Smith was selected to arrange and animate a plan for
chacing this encroacher from his strong holds, who sailed from
England for Constantinople, vested both with diplomatic as well as
military powers, in the Autumn of 1798.</p>

<p>Having reached the Ottoman Capital, he, in union with his
brother, discussed and signed a treaty of triple alliance between Great
Britain, Russia, and the Turk. The outlines of future operations
were also framed, which suggested an attack by the Pacha Djezzar
from the deserts of Syria, upon the frontiers of Lower Egypt,
who was to be seconded by an Army, penetrating across Asia
Minor, while a maritime diversion took place at the different mouths
of the Nile, and the remnants of Mourad Bey's forces, already
twice defeated, should adopt a harassing system from the Upper
Province.</p>

<p>Bonaparte having learned the active views of Djezzar, and the
arrival of Sir Sidney, which foreboded instantaneous hostility,
resolved to anticipate their schemes, and to march into Syria. After
having adjusted all his measures in Lower Egypt, he put his Army
in motion early in February, consisting nearly of 12000 men.&mdash;To
detail his progress across the deserts would exceed my limits.</p>

<p>Upon the 10th of that month Bonaparte, in person, left Cairo to
head his troops, whom he joined at El Arisch on the 17th; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
village and its castle, were completely gained on the 25th. Ghazah
likewise surrendered, and Jaffa, that theatre of his indelible crimes,
was carried by storm upon the 7th of March. After the most
incredible hardships, and many a harassing contest with the numerous
Mamelukes, the French Army ascended the heights which
command St. Jean d'Acre, upon the morning of the 18th of March,
and commenced its investment.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney had employed this momentous interval, in a train of
judicious measures. Leaving Constantinople on the 19th of February,
he arrived off Alexandria upon the 3d of March, where he relieved
Commodore Trowbridge, and assumed the command of the Naval
Forces. That city had been long closely blockaded by Capt. Hood,
and Sir Sidney, anxious to divert the French from their purposes against
Syria, commenced its bombardment, but perceiving it fruitless, he
proceeded for that coast in order to rally its affrightened Pacha, and
to intercept the battering cannon destined for the siege of St. Acre,
which he well knew must be transported by sea.</p>

<p>His conceptions were most prophetic, and all his plans were
executed in a masterly stile. Reaching Caiffe upon the 11th of
March, he afterwards steered for St. Jean d'Acre, where he arrived
on the 15th, and concerted a system of defence with Djezzar.</p>

<p>On the 18th he chaced and captured the looked for flotilla off
Cape Carmel, afterwards landed the ammunition it contained, and
mounted the heavy cannon upon the ramparts of the Syrian bulwark
and capital. Its works were much strengthened under the able eye
of Colonel Philippeaux, and never were a few critical hours better
applied than those which preceded the investment of St. Acre. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
greater part of the Marines of the Tygre, Theseus, and Alliance
were disembarked, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel (now
Sir John) Douglas, who was vested by Sir Sidney with the Brevet
Commission of Colonel, in order that the Turkish Forces, and the
Seamen, who were also landed, might be under his orders.</p>

<p>From the 17th to the 23d of March the boats of the Tygre and
Theseus were constantly employed in union with some gun vessels,
in harassing the enemy's posts, checking his approaches, and cutting
off his coasting supplies, upon which services Lieutenant Burton and
the Marines under his command were distinguished for persevering
gallantry.</p>

<p>Upon the 20th the French opened their trenches against the front
of the salient angle, on the East side of the town, and within 900
yards. Between that and the 1st of April, they kept up a cannonade,
when it appearing to the enemy that a breach had been made in the
tower, against which their fire had been levelled, and conceiving
also that the counterscarp had suffered from a mine they had sprung,
the republicans advanced to storm it. In both, however, they were
deceived; and though the Turks were at first panic struck, yet
stimulated by the heroic examples of the Seamen and Marines, they
returned to their post, and continued to pour down a shower of stones
and grenades upon the assailants, until they retired with a heavy loss.</p>

<p>The squadron having been driven from its anchorage in the Bay,
encouraged the French to push on their approaches to the counterscarp,
a part of which they destroyed, and also made a lodgment in the
North East angle of the wall, whence they began to undermine the
tower. To avert its effects a sortie was deemed, advisable on the 7th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of April, in which the British Seamen and Marines were to dash into
the mine, while the Turks were to attempt the republican trenches
to the right and left. Colonel Douglas led this attack, in three
columns, at the head of each of which were the Marines, just before
the break of day, and it would, most probably, have been a surprize,
if the undisciplined clamour of their Mahometan Allies, had not
proclaimed their approach to the enemy.</p>

<p>This handful of Seamen and Marines carried the first and second
lines of the French trenches, parallel to the mine, although defended
by the flower of Buonaparte's Army, and maintained them, until the
mine was destroyed by the gallant exertions of Lieutenant White and
his Sailor pioneers. That Officer very much distinguished himself,
and with many others, who were badly wounded, was indebted for
an escape from captivity to the cool intrepidity of Sir John Douglas
and the remains of his little detachment, who bore them off into the
garrison amidst a tremendous fire from the enemy.</p>

<p>I must here pause to render justice to the memory of one of the
mildest and bravest of men, who unfortunately fell upon that day.
I mean Major Thomas Oldfield of the corps of Marines. No eulogy
of mine is necessary to adorn his tomb. I go to the records of a brave
foe, where his epitaph is written, and who witnessed and recognized
his valour. It is the honest testimony of a Soldier&mdash;of Gen. Berthier,
whose own name has often been conspicuous amongst the splendid
details of the Armies of France. He speaks in these emphatic terms:
"On the 18th Germinal (7th April) the enemy, at break of day,
came on with an attack on our left and our centre; each column
was headed by British Marines belonging to the ships, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
colours were seen waving with those of Djezzar, and the batteries
were all manned by English troops. The enemy made an attempt
to surprize our advanced posts; but their design was seen through.
We received them with a brisk fire from our parallels, and all that
appeared were either killed or wounded. The enemy ultimately
retired without gaining an inch towards destroying our works.
The central column acted with more obstinacy. Their object was
to penetrate to the entrance of our mine; they were commanded
by Major Thomas Oldfield. He advanced boldly towards the
entrance of the mine, at the head of some of his intrepid countrymen;
they attacked like heroes, and were received by heroes;
death only checked their bold career; the remainder retreated,
and took refuge in the fortress. The approaches of our parallels
remained covered with the dead bodies of English and of Turks.
The corpse of Major Thomas Oldfield was carried off by our
Grenadiers, they brought him to our Head Quarters, he was on the
point of death, but on his arrival he was no more. His sword,
to which he had done so much honour, was also honoured after
his fall&mdash;it remains in the hands of one of our Grenadiers; he was
buried amongst us, and has carried with him the esteem of the
whole French Army."</p>

<p>This was the effusion of a brave enemy. I will superadd the
animated address of Sir Sidney Smith to a meeting of the Anniversary
of the Naval Asylum, on the 2d of June, 1802, and with it
shall close this tributary theme.</p>

<p>After having spoken of the many virtues of the amiable Captain
Miller, Sir Sidney thus enlarges upon the merits of his departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
friend, Major Oldfield:&mdash;"The next is Major Oldfield, of the
Marines. I will tell the company where the body of this brave
man was contended for, and they will judge where and how he
died; it was a sortie of the garrison of St. John D'Acre, when
attacked by General Buonaparte, that Major Oldfield, who commanded
a column, was missing. On our troops advancing he
was found&mdash;his body was found at the mouth of one of the enemy's
mines, and at the foot of their works. Our brave men hooked
him by the neckcloth as he lay dead, to draw him off; the enemy
at the same time pierced him in the side with a halbert, and each
party struggled for the body. The neckcloth gave way, and the
enemy succeeded in dragging to their works this brave man; and
here I must do them justice, which such gallant foes are justly
entitled to, they buried him with all the honours of war."</p>

<p>Lieut. Beattie, of Marines, was wounded in this ever-memorable
sortie, which reflected a bright lustre upon all that composed it.</p>

<p>The personal attention of Buonaparte to the operations of the
siege was soon after diverted to another object, in repelling the bold
attacks of the Samaritan Arabs, whom, by a train of able measures,
he beat in every part of an extended line, and drove them
across the Jordan.</p>

<p>My bounds will not allow me to detail the many incidents of
this brilliant siege, where perseverance was constantly opposed to
vigorous effort.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, the French having cannonaded and made a
breach, they a fourth time risqued a storm, but they were repulsed
with heavy loss. The flanking fire from two ravelins run out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
each side of the enemy's nearest approach, and in which the Marines
of the Tigre and Theseus, to the admiration and gratitude of the
Turkish garrison, worked and fought, though exposed to an
incessant discharge upon them, contributed chiefly to the salvation
of the place upon that day. The disposition of those ships, and
of the inferior craft, was so judicious, that the republican trenches
were unceasingly annoyed. These progressive duties afforded many
tests of Naval zeal and courage. The early fall of Captain Wilmot,
of that Corps, was felt a heavy loss, as he was an excellent Officer
and a worthy man. The unfortunate death of Colonel Philippeaux
would have been considered as an irretrievable disaster, if it had not
been compensated by the active talents of Sir John Douglas, upon
whom devolved the additional cares of an Engineer. These were
much lessened by the co-operating abilities of Sir Sidney Smith,
whose scientific and comprehensive mind promptly embraces a wide
scope of knowledge, and its dictates are ever quickly pushed into
action by the energies of a resolute soul.</p>

<p>The ravelins upon which the Marines worked, within ten yards
of the enemy's approaches, were in a progress of completion between
the 2d and 8th of May, and were each night assailed by the
French, who were as often repulsed, in nine different attempts to
storm, with immense slaughter. The gallantry of my Corps, in all,
exceeds praise. Many sorties were made to incommode their
covering works, and most unprecedented were the bodily fatigues
and mental anxiety of all.</p>

<p>The republicans had some time past opened with heavy guns,
which they had received from Jaffa, and from which a serious impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
was made upon the works of the garrison. Resorting to
fresh expedients, Buonaparte tried to effect a new breach in the
eastern curtain, by a sap and mine; but the unremitting activity of
the brave defenders of Acre, by making approaches under ground,
destroyed the frame-work and his hopes. Again directing his
attacks upon the Tower, an effort to establish a lodgment in the
glacis was once more unavailing.</p>

<p>Fifty-one days of vindictive and unceasing contest, save those
short intervals necessary to recruit exhausted nature, had elapsed,
when the garrison beheld their long-expected reinforcements under
Hassan Bey.</p>

<p>Foiled in every essay to carry the place, Buonaparte saw with
grief and disappointment this flotilla, which was to blast all his
ambitious schemes, and to relieve his now almost worn-out opponents.
With a desperate ardour, impelled by wounded pride, he
lost not a moment to prepare and advance to the assault, in the
sanguine idea that by one bold effort he might consummate his ardent
wishes before Hassan's troops could land. At ten, on the night of
the 7th of May, the carnage began. Mr. Scroder, Master's Mate of
the Theseus, from an 18 pounder in the Light House Castle; a 24,
under Mr. Jones, Midshipman of the Theseus, mounted in the north
ravelin, and two 68 pound carronades, under the direction of Mr.
Bray, carpenter of the latter ship, which threw shells from two
germes in the Mole, added to the Turkish musquetry, committed
dreadful havoc amongst the French columns in moving on to the
attack. Much might be said were I to diverge upon the many
chequered events of the night and the following day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
morning's dawn displayed the enemy's standard flying on the outer
angle of the Tower, which their intrepidity had carried, having
ascended on its ruins. Here they made a lodgment by two traverses
across the ditch, constructed and filled with sand bags, and the
bodies of their dead.</p>

<p>Feeble is my panegyric of the unsurpassed heroism, the decisive
resources, the conciliating address, and bold expedients of Sir
Sidney Smith, during 25 hours of almost constant action. They
have been but rarely equalled, and will never be outdone. He was
well seconded by his able coadjutor Sir John Douglas, who combines
a natural perseverance of character with the most manly judgment.
Their virtues transcended to every subordinate rank, and animated
all.</p>

<p>The British uniform was every where, even in the individual,
a rallying point, and my Countrymen and my Corps, through this
unrivalled defence, lay claim to the pre-eminent glory of having
fixed a barrier to the boundless ambition of Buonaparte, and of
republican France. Egypt was conquered at Acre, and India preserved.
The Turks, aroused by the daring examples of a few
British Seamen and Marines, performed feats of enthusiastic valour,
and the French were driven, with immense slaughter, from every
hold.</p>

<p>The dispirited and reduced state of the Army before Acre, in
consequence of these heavy losses, urged Buonaparte to withdraw
the division of Kleber, from the fords of the Jordan. Much was
anticipated from this Corps, from its recent good conduct near to
Nazareth. It was early destined to ascend that breach, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
so many of their countrymen had fallen victims. But the gallant
sortie of a Turkish regiment, anxious to wipe away the stigma of
indiscipline, cut out sufficient work for them, and carried the third
parallel of the enemy. Their forward zeal exposed them to some
loss in pushing on to the second trench; but they found sufficient
employ for Kleber, who, instead of proceeding against the breach,
was obliged to devote all his efforts to regain his works.</p>

<p>The attacks upon the 10th of May, were the last vigorous
essays of the French to carry St. Acre. Hitherto, lavish of blood,
Buonaparte saw its ineffectual waste, and the Soldiery perceiving
themselves offered up as daily sacrifices to his insatiable ambition,
lost all their ardour. Unrestrained by the principles of honour, he
resorted to the blackest treachery, and the unexampled refuge of a
Soldier&mdash;that of poisoning his opponent, and demanding a cessation
of arms, in order to break it. His vain attempt to subdue a brave
garrison during this sacred interval, in one day withered all his
laurels, most impressively delineated his genuine character, and
will one day be numbered amongst his crimes, by the historian of
that country which he now rules with tyrannic despotism.</p>

<p>Precluded from every hope of success, Buonaparte retreated in
disorder from before the walls of Acre, during the night of the 20th
of May, Sir Sidney and his brave associates did not fail to pursue
him, and to annoy his flying columns along the sea beach, while
the Arabs, assembled by his counsels, harassed their rear.</p>

<p>Thus ended this memorable siege, during which, 53 British
Seamen and Marines were killed, 13 drowned, 113 wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and 32 taken prisoners. It has immortalized every gallant fellow
who bore a part in it.</p>

<p>The services of Sir Sidney Smith and Colonel Douglas did not
terminate here. Although in many instances they were unfortunate,
through Turkish indiscipline, they were still splendid in their
nature, and momentous in their consequences.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney, returning to Cyprus, by his zeal and the general
esteem in which he was held, raised an army of 13,000 men, which,
being united to the Turkish fleet, and some English Seamen and
Marines, proceeded to Aboukir, were landed, and headed by Colonel
Douglas, who volunteered to lead them against Buonaparte in person.
The Turks taking flight, were all either killed or taken, and their
Chief, with Colonel Bromley, a French Emigrant Officer, owed
their preservation from the sabres of the republican cavalry by
riding into the sea, where they were picked up by Sir Sidney, who
bravely rowed in shore, and kept their pursuers in awe, with a
field-piece in the bow of his boat.</p>

<p>A second army, collected from Rhodes and other islands, attacked
the French at Damietta, under Sir Sidney and Colonel Douglas,
destroyed their magazines there, and had erected cannon against
the French redoubt; but Turkish disobedience and insubordination
subjected this mass to a disaster similar to that of Aboukir. Sensible
of Colonel Douglas's professional talents, the Grand Vizier entreated
Sir Sidney to permit his repairing to Jaffa, in order to organize his
army there; he accordingly went thither.</p>

<p>Colonel Douglas, during four months, shared in the scanty
allowances of the Ottoman army, subsisting upon two ounces of rice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
daily, sent from the Vizier's table, at which no Christian can sit;
drinking brackish water, and constantly sleeping in the open air of
the desert. Under all these pressures and privations, the energies of
that Officer were, however, so great, that he gained possession of the
wells of El-Arisch; seized a supply of provisions there, of which
the troops were in utter need, carried the place, and by that means
kept together the Ottoman army, on the eve of self-dissolution.</p>

<p>Monsieur Cazel, the French Commandant, who delivered up his
sword to the Colonel, avowed that its conquest was almost solely
achieved by the gallant British detachment which he led.</p>

<p>This important key to the Syrian desert, again restored to its
proper owners, facilitated the convention of El-Arisch, by which
the whole French army was to evacuate Egypt, and return home.
This having been subsequently cancelled, afforded a fresh field for
the valour of my Corps upon its shores.</p>

<p>The following letter from the Grand Vizier to Sir Sidney Smith,
fully identifies his grateful sense of the merits of Colonel, now Sir
John Douglas, of Marines.</p>

<p>"To the Commander of his Britannic Majesty's Fleet, to our
much-esteemed and beloved friend Sir Sidney Smith, our best
greeting. May your destiny be ever prosperous, and your health
flourishing.</p>

<p>"We send you by the present our friendly advice and information
concerning his Britannic Majesty's Officer, Colonel Douglas,
to make known unto you, that, during his stay at, and co-operation
with the army under our command, he has evinced not
only the greatest activity and skill, but also the most undaunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
courage and bravery. As his glorious and faithful services have
afforded us the highest satisfaction, so do we wish the same may
prove to him most honourable and advantageous; and as we
think it just and expedient for all Powers and Sovereigns nobly to
reward eminent merit, so have we written this letter, for the
express purpose, to beg you to transmit to our dear, most respected,
and great friend and ally, the King of Great Britain, a faithful
narrative of Colonel Douglas's gallant behaviour, that accordingly
he may be raised to the rank he so well deserves. We hope and
trust, that at the receipt of our letter, you will act in conformity
with this sincere desire.</p>

<p class="right">"L. S.</p>

<p>"Given at our camp, before El-Arisch,</p>

<p class="pad4">"Feb. 2, 1800."</p>

<p>Sir John Douglas has lately received a solid mark of his country's
approbation, in a pension of 400<i>l</i>. a year, commencing from that
day upon which Buonaparte retreated from the walls of St. Acre.</p>

<p>It was the destiny of my Corps to participate in a short, but
brilliant campaign, which drove the French out of the Neapolitan
kingdom, and restored its Monarch to the throne.</p>

<p>Amongst the followers of the fallen fortunes of his Sicilian
Majesty, in his retreat to Palermo, was Cardinal Ruffo, whose
enterprizing genius planned the loyal design of paving the way for
the return of his self-exiled King, to the former seat of his power.
Repairing to Calabria, he quickly collected a large army, by rekindling
a spirit of royalism, exerting his clerical influence amongst
people alike fanatical and ignorant, and by alternately exercising
the functions of the Soldier and of the Cardinal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain, now Sir William D'Arley, of Marines, landed singly
in the Neapolitan territory, in order to acquire a knowledge of the
state, strength, and views of the Royal party; during which period
he made many a hair-breadth escape. So judiciously did he discharge
this important mission, that the command of a district was assigned
him; he was entrusted with a high military post, in which he
continued to animate the motley army of Ruffo, by his counsels and
his energies. In a variety of actions they fought, and beat the
united French and rebel troops, who had possessed themselves of
the kingdom of Naples, and had organized it into a republic; taking
also Cotrona and Cantanzaro.</p>

<p>Introductory to their principal operations, the British squadron
was extremely active. In April, Captain Hallowell, with some
Seamen and Marines, obtained Procita and its castle, in the Gulf
of Naples; while Captain Knox, of my Corps, was detached to the
Isle of Ischia, which, with its strong fortress, was delivered up
without resistance.</p>

<p>The robberies, murders, and rapine committed by their French
friends in Italy had alienated almost every heart, and wherever an
Englishman appeared, he was greeted as the deliverer of a country
groaning under the bitterest sufferings.</p>

<p>A partial debarkation of some Marines and Sailors at Salerno,
after having effected its capture, was obliged to retreat, before very
superior numbers of the enemy. The cool gallantry of Lieutenant
Vyvion, of Marines, upon that occasion, gave a strong earnest of future
eminence. He was a young man of the most promising talents, but
his country and his brethren have now to deplore his subsequent fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Cardinal Ruffo, learning the evacuation of Naples, and the
defeats of the French armies by the Russian General Suwarrow, put
in motion his army towards that Capital; part of which he gained
upon the day of St. Anthony's feast. Exceeding his powers, a
treaty which he had concluded with the Members of the Republican
Government, and the Patriots in the Forts, was cancelled by his
Sicilian Majesty, and the transports in which they were embarked
for Toulon, were blockaded by the British squadron.</p>

<p>Many of the rebel party, united with their allies the French,
retiring to the strong holds of St. Elmo, Ovo, and Nuova, it was
judged expedient to land the Marines, who, with other auxiliaries,
were destined to reduce them. On the 27th of June they were
disembarked, to the number of 800 men, under the following Officers,
who had the honour of accomplishing the important services that
ensued, with much credit.</p>

<p>Four hundred Portugueze Marines were also landed, which,
joined to 500 Swiss, 450 Russians, and 70 Greeks, formed a total
of 2170, besides Officers.</p>

<p>Captain Hood took possession of the Castles of Ovo and Nuovo,
in which he was placed with a garrison of Seamen, and in his
public character preserved the peace of that turbulent Capital,
during the whole series of that trying duty.</p>

<p>Captain Trowbridge, of the Royal Navy, conducted with much
ability those military operations, which may be said to have reinstated
the Neapolitan King upon his throne.</p>

<p>At five on the morning of the 30th of June, he marched from
Castle Nuovo, with the British and Portugueze Marines, was joined
by the Russians in Naples, and proceeded instantly against St. Elmo,
whose Commandant he summoned to surrender. Being answered in
the negative, that zealous and spirited Officer lost no time in erecting
batteries against the Castle. Between the 3d and 5th of July, nine
heavy cannon and eight mortars were opened on its garrison and
works, which played incessantly, in the hope of effecting a breach
sufficient to storm. On the 6th, four mortars were added, and by
the indefatigable labours of the Seamen, six 36-pounders were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
dragged to the summit of an almost inaccessible precipice, which
soon compelled Monsieur Mejan to capitulate. The Marine Grenadiers
marched into the Castle on the 12th, and the enemy, upwards
of 1500, were allowed the honours of war.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the main body of the army returned to Castle
Nuovo, from whence they advanced against Capua, that key to
Naples, upon the 19th, where they arrived on the 21st, pitched
their tents near to its walls, and in a short time opened batteries,
which continued to play against the town until the 27th, when terms
were discussed and agreed on.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the French, to the number of 1500, marched out,
and were conveyed to Naples, under an escort of 400 Marines, and
two squadrons of General Acton's Cavalry.</p>

<p>The conduct of Captain Trowbridge was prompt and animated,
and he spoke highly of the unremitting attention and discipline
of Colonel Strickland, Major Creswell, the Officers and men.
The exertions of those of the allied troops were also highly
meritorious.</p>

<p>Returning to Naples, an embarkation took place against Gaieta
on the 30th of July, where they landed on the 3d of August, gained
possession of its gates on the next day, and upon the 5th, delivered
up the town to the loyal subjects of his Majesty the King of Naples.</p>

<p>The retreat of the French armies was felt throughout Italy, and
their disasters roused the Tuscans to arms, who drove them from
their bosom. Florence was abandoned, and Leghorn was evacuated;
but Rome was unsubdued. Its besiegers had been driven from its
walls, and every effort to reduce it was ineffectual. It did not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
however, resist against the tenders of British honour; for on Captain
Trowbridge appearing off the mouth of the Tiber, and a summons
being sent to General Garnier, he agreed to surrender Rome, Civita
Vechia, and every dependency within the state, to that Commander.</p>

<p>Some Seamen, and the Marines of the Culloden and Minotaur,
occupied Corneto and Tolsa, as well as Civita Vechia, during the
29th and 30th of September, while the enemy, amounting to 5000,
were sent off, agreeable to the terms of capitulation.</p>

<p>Captain Trowbridge maintained the acknowledged faith of his
Country, in every article, with a dignity becoming the high character
in which he stood. Colonel Strickland supported that discipline in
his Corps, which must have ensured success against a contending
enemy. This train of important services, derives a double merit,
from that rapidity with which they were performed.</p>

<p>During the present year Earl St. Vincent resigned the command of
the Mediterranean Fleet. The system by which he maintained its good
order, is worthy of being adopted by every Officer in the British Navy.</p>

<p>One of the most gallant boarding contests took place upon that
station, during the day of the 9th of June, which appears on the
face of this war. It was cutting out a Spanish polacre of 10 guns
and 113 men, from the port of La Selva, supported by a heavy
battery, and a large body of men under arms on the shore, by the
boats of the Success, carrying only 42 men.</p>

<p>Lieuts. Facey and Stupart, of the Navy, and Lieut. Davison,
of my Corps, headed this daring enterprize. They were all distinguished;
but limiting the detail of it to my peculiar province, I am
led to notice the cool courage of that promising brother Officer, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
taking a steady aim with a pistol amidst this confused scene, shot a
Swiss Soldier in the mouth, who had levelled his musket at Mr.
Pomeroy Peter, a brave young Midshipman, in the act of boarding
over a high close netting. Mr. Peter did the rest with a pike. A
gallant Marine, Thomas Needham, having his right arm broken by a
grape shot, on being asked by Lieutenant Facey, if it was not
disabled? answered "Yes, but, thank God, I can pull a trigger with
my right, and with my left hand I can still manage a cutlass."
In this state he continued to fight until the vessel was carried.</p>

<p>In the West Indies the Dutch Colony of Surinam was taken
without opposition. Lieutenant M'Gee, of Marines, and his party
from the Trent, behaved most handsomely, in union with their
brethren the Seamen, by storming a battery in a bay near Cape Roso,
and afterwards bringing from under it a large Spanish ship and
schooner.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the 25th of October that Captain (now
Sir Edward) Hamilton, at the head of 100 Seamen and Marines,
attacked and carried the Hermione, of 44 guns, after having killed
and wounded 216 men, with the single loss of Lieutenant J. Busey,
acting Lieutenant of the Surprize. After the greatest feats of valour
in all, he brought her out from under the formidable batteries of
Porto Cavallo. John Ingram and Joseph Titley, private Marines,
were wounded upon this honorable occasion, which sufficiently speaks
its own praise.</p>

<p>In the East, La Forte, of 50 guns, was captured by the British
Sybille, after a desperate resistance, during which Captain Cooke
unfortunately fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Every domestic event of this year sinks, in consequence, when
compared to the expedition against Holland. Its details, however, do
not properly fall within my narrative. After having gained possession
of the Helder, the duties allotted to the Marines, were to garrison
its forts, while the Army, under Sir Ralph Abercrombie, penetrated
into the Country. These my corps performed with their usual alertness
and zeal, and much to the satisfaction of their superiors. Unfortunate
as was the issue of the attempt, originally undertaken at a late
season of the year, and against a dangerous coast, still the very
important capture of the remains of the Batavian Navy, amply
compensated for its final miscarriage. An unsurpassed unanimity
between the land and naval services prevailed, and English valour
was conspicuous throughout.</p>

<p>A garrison of Seamen and Marines having been placed at
Limmen Town, in West Friezland, under Captain Boorder, of the
Navy, consisting of only 157 men, was attacked at five on the
morning of the 11th of October by more than 700 of the enemy, in
four quarters. Their advanced party against the North battery was
surrounded and taken by the seamen, and after a long contest, the
whole gave way. The Marines immediately pursued, killed and
wounded more than 40, and would have taken their colours and
cannon if they had not, in the rout, broken down a bridge, which
checked our progress. Captain Boorder says, "that Lieutenants
Wyburn, Howel, Higginson, and Gardner, of Marines, behaved
with honour to themselves, and credit to their Country, and
that their men distinguished themselves in a most gallant manner."
The names of Captains Mortlock, Sir Harry Neale, Winthorp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Bolton, Macnamara, and Cuninghame, with their Officers, Seamen,
and Marines, stand meritedly high in the subordinate catalogue of
this year's naval deeds.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>wenty thousand Marines were voted for the service of 1800.</p>

<p>Every revolving year seemed to add to the naval superiority of
Great Britain. In each quarter the enemy's fleets were blockaded
within their ports; the happy result of our reiterated victories.</p>

<p>In the Mediterranean, Lord Keith, by his cruizers, was highly
instrumental in producing the fall of Genoa, to the Austrian General
Melas, by cutting off its supplies, and occasional bombardments.</p>

<p>Early in 1800 a battalion of Marines was landed at Malta, which
had withstood a tedious blockade, and still held out with uncommon
perseverance. The occasion presented no opportunities of signalizing
themselves, but by the most exemplary good conduct, under the
following Officers:</p>

</div></div>

<p>On the 5th of September La Valette capitulated, of which the
Marines took possession. The indefatigable exertions of Captain
(now Sir A.) Ball, of the Royal Navy, did him much honor, and
it was partly owing to the seasonable arrival of Major General Pigott
with a reinforcement, as well as to the debarkation of the Marines,
that this important key to Egypt was so soon added to our dominion.
The steady vigilance of the Navy, during a blockade of two years,
had a pre-eminent share in this final event. The fortress of Savona,
reduced to famine, by the activity of Captain Downman and his little
squadron, surrendered also to him and the Austrian General St. Julien,
on the 16th of May.</p>

<p>The Genereux and Guillaume Tell, of 74 and 84 guns, were
captured by our cruizers in February and March. They were the
only remnants of the French fleet after the memorable battle of
Aboukir.</p>

<p>This year abounds with many examples of inferior enterprize,
in which the subalterns of my corps gave very handsome pledges
of what may be expected from them upon every allotted
opportunity.</p>

<p>The attack and bringing out the Spanish corvette, San Josef,
protected also by a heavy battery of five guns, from under the fortress
of Fangerolle, reflected the highest credit upon the spirit of Lieutenants
Beaufort and Huish, of the Pheaton, and Duncan Campbell, of
Marines. He and Mr. Beaufort were wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>The Seamen and Marines of the Mermaid, under Captain Oliver,
merit notice in having cut out and destroyed 9 vessels, under a fort
near Cape Corsette.</p>

<p>The conduct of Lieut. Yeo and his brave followers in the port
of Cecenatico, where they rendered 13 merchantmen unserviceable,
was most distinguished. Lieut. Jewell, of Marines, in a detachment of
this nature under Captain Hillyer, which gallantly brought out two
large corvettes from the road of Barcelona, amidst a shower of shot
and shells, behaved with much courage and conduct throughout that
service. These detailed exploits were performed on the Mediterranean
station during this year.</p>

<p>The Dutch island of Curacoa, in South America, when on the eve
of being possessed by a French force, claimed the protection of
Captain Watkins, of his Majesty's frigate Nereide, who landed his
Marines and some Seamen, who had the honor of deterring the
enemy from his attempt, and securing that settlement.</p>

<p>Goree, on the coast of Africa, surrendered to Sir Charles Hamilton,
of La Melpomene, when Captain M'Cleverty, with the Marines of
the squadron, were landed to garrison it.</p>

<p>A very gallant single action was fought off St. Domingo, between
La Seine, Captain Milne, and La Vengeance French frigate, which
terminated in the republican ship striking her flag. Captain Milne,
who had oftener than once approved himself a brave Officer, thus
speaks of Lieutenant Macdonald, who commanded the Marines of
La Seine: "I am indebted to the services of Mr. Macdonald, of
Marines, who was taken down wounded, and came up again
when dressed, but was obliged, from a second wound, to be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
below; but I am happy to state, the life of this valuable Officer
will be saved, to render further services to his Majesty. The
behaviour of the Marines was such as does them the highest credit."</p>

<p>In the East, Lieutenant Owen, of my corps, volunteered from
the Adamant to assist in destroying the French frigate La Precieuse,
which had been run on shore by that ship and the Tremendous near
Fort Louis, on the Isle of France; a service that was spiritedly
executed under a heavy fire from the batteries, and they brought off
some of the Officers and men prisoners.</p>

<p>The achievements upon the home station in this style of warfare,
were both crouded and brilliant, and it is with a mixture of exultation
and of pride, that so many amongst the rising generation of my
brethren, appear upon those honorable annals.</p>

<p>Amongst the foremost stands the name of Lieutenant (now
Adjutant) Gerrard, of Marines, who volunteered from the Fisguard,
to attack a convoy at St. Croix, laden with provisions and stores
for the French fleet at Brest; which material object was in part
effected, in opposition to the fire from a strong battery, three armed
vessels they took, and a line of musquetry on the shore. Eight
of inferior note were captured, and twenty were run on the rocks.
Lieutenants Burke, Dean, Stamp, and Price, of the Royal Navy,
also gave shining patterns of valour.</p>

<p>Another attempt upon some of the enemy's vessels at the mouth
of the river Quimper on the 23d of June, although not equally
prosperous, was still alike glorious to Lieutenants Burke of the
Renown, and Parker of the Defence, as well as Lieutenant Gerrard.
After reaching the mouth of that river, the Marines were landed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
both its sides, under the command of Lieutenants Burke and Gerrard,
who were to protect the boats under Mr. Parker, in their approach to
the vessels of war and small craft. But the enemy had removed
them to an inaccessible distance, and this bold essay terminated in
the destruction of three strong batteries with their guns, by these
divisions.</p>

<p>The cutting out La Desiree, from the roads of Dunkirk, will be
long remembered, and must for ever establish the personal intrepidity
of Lieutenants M'Dermitt and Pierce, of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>The vigilance of Sir John Warren and his flying squadron, afforded
another display of subordinate zeal on the 1st and 2d of July.</p>

<p>The scene of action was within the island of Noirmoutier, and
in the bay of Bourneuf, and the object was to attack some armed
vessels and a convoy bound for Brest, covered by 6 heavy batteries
on the South East part of the former, besides flanking guns on every
point. By 12 on the night of the 1st of July, they carried 5 armed
ships, and 15 merchantmen, but on finding it impossible to bring
them out over the sand banks, they were all burnt. This dashing
business was achieved by 113 Seamen, and 61 Marines, headed by
Lieutenants Burke, Dean, and Garrett, of the Navy, 11 petty
Officers, and Lieutenants Thompson, Ballingham, Gerrard, and
Hutton, of my corps. All the boats upon returning, grounded, and
in this situation they were exposed to an unceasing fire from the forts,
and from the platoons of 400 troops in their rear.</p>

<p>It was under this trying circumstance, that, with true British
intrepidity, they resolutely dragged their boats upwards of two miles
over the sands, until they floated, when they levelled all their efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
against one vessel, sufficiently large to accomplish their retreat.
Four Officers and eighty-eight men, however, became prisoners,
while more than 100 secured their safety by unrelaxing valour.</p>

<p>The capture of Le Cerbere gun-brig, made under the batteries of
Port Louis, the fire of some small craft, within a mile of three French
men of war, and against four times their numbers, has immortalized
the fame of Lieut. Coghlan, and Mr. Paddon, of the Royal Navy,
and all their associates. It can scarcely find a parallel upon the
registers of history.</p>

<p>Lieut. Burke, of the Renown, the Seamen and Marines under
his auspices, were again conspicuous in the assault of La Guipe
French privateer, of 22 guns and 161 men, which they took, after
a desperate resistance, near the Narrows of Rendonella, in the bay
of Vigo. That valuable Officer, Lieut. Burke, was badly wounded,
besides twelve Seamen and five Marines, and four of both classes
were killed.</p>

<p>It was in testimony of those repeated deeds that the Officers
and ship's company of the Fisguard, presented Lieut. Gerrard, of
Marines, with a sword, accompanied by the flattering tribute I have
already described. His Country, as I have said, has recently attested
her gratitude, by conferring upon him one of the Adjutancies of his
Corps, for which he is eminently qualified.</p>

<p>The determined spirit of Lieut. M'Cullen, of Marines, and his
little party of twenty-four men, in following up Captain Price's
orders, against the Victoire privateer, of Boulogne, near to Issigny,
is worthy of much commendation. He towed her off from the shore
under the discharge of some hundred musquetry, and brought her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
prize to the island of St. Marcou. Lieut. Steevens covered him most
gallantly in his gun-brig, the Sparkler.</p>

<p>Imitating this brilliant system, another blow to the enemy's
commerce was given by the boats of the Montague and Magnificent,
conducted by Lieuts. Blissett, Knight, Griffiths, and Dunlop, of the
Royal Navy, and in which Lieuts. Alexander, Montgomerie, Mitchell,
and Jordan, of Marines, bravely volunteered. The whole
proceeded against a convoy of fourteen sail in Port Danenne, near
to L'Orient, all of which were grounded under a battery, that fired
round and grape shot, as well as two of the vessels which were
armed, upon the boats as they approached.</p>

<p>This service was most completely executed, as they took eleven,
and burnt one; leaving only two behind which they were unable to
bring out. Captain Knight acknowledged the conduct of all to have
been most regular and bold.</p>

<p>These little details are powerful evidences of the spirit of the
times. Upon an aggregate scale they are certainly of national
moment, and sufficiently prove how much may be accomplished by
English intrepidity, when happily seconded by a well-regulated
discipline.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XLVI" id="CHAP_XLVI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAP. XLVI.</a></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">A</span>t no period of her existence as a Nation, did Britain portend a
speedier dissolution, although at none did she ever appear in a more
dignified attitude, than at the commencement of 1801.</p>

<p>Alternately deserted by every Ally, she was not only engaged in
an arduous contest with some of the most powerful States of Europe,
but was threatened by the revival of a Maritime discussion, backed
by an armed neutrality amongst its Northern Powers, evidently
levelled against her existence. A confederacy so hostile to our very
being, could not but arouse the land to assert their long established
rights; and, however hazardous an appeal to arms might be under
the existing crisis, it was still deemed a better, and more glorious
alternative, than tacitly to allow any innovators, however powerful,
to undermine those commercial pillars, upon which the Empire had
so long flourished, and stood. Temporizing measures being but ill
suited to the occasion, and little congenial to the spirit of the times,
a general embargo was laid upon all Russian, Swedish, and Danish
vessels within our ports, while a fleet was equipped for the Baltic,
whose cannon were destined to become the interpreters of our injured
privileges, as well as the delegated agents for the salutary restoration
of peace.</p>

<p>Keeping pace with such Naval exertions, to which the Country
looked for its salvation, the Marine corps experienced an effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
augmentation unprecedented on its historic annals. A vote of
22,696 men passed for the three first lunar months of 1801, which
was subsequently enlarged to 30,000 for the future services of the
year.</p>

<p>I am naturally led to follow the progress of those gallant fellows
to the coasts of the Baltic, by whose great achievements those
impending dangers which seemed ready to erase their devoted
Country from amongst the list of nations, were so quickly dispelled.</p>

<p>The object of this armament having been publicly avowed and
known, the occasion evinced the spirited zeal of Lieutenant Colonel
Winter, of my corps, by his stepping out of the routine of divisional
service, and volunteering to head a battalion of Marines, upon these
more perilous duties. The handsome tender of that able Officer, was
not, however, accepted.</p>

<p>Upon the 12th of March the British fleet set sail, and passed the
Sound on the 30th, encountering, in its way, an incessant but
bloodless discharge from the cannon of Cronenburgh, when it
anchored near to the isle of Huin. The battle of the 2d of April,
fought under the superintending example and auspices of Lord Nelson,
needs no description to add to its splendour. Its merits can best be
appreciated by its immediate effects. Upon that great man's brow
was placed the laurel, entwined with the olive, and both were the
growth of a single day. It led to peace with our old friends, the
Danes, and overthrew a Confederacy, upon the consequences of
which speculation is set at bay.</p>

<p>The gallant Sir Thomas Graves nobly seconded his superior, and
it is to be remembered, in honor to his name, that he volunteered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
complete the final destruction of those Northern Opponents, if a
cessation of arms had not healed every difference.</p>

<p>Eight hundred and seventy five Seamen and Marine Soldiers were
killed and wounded upon that momentous day. Lieutenant
Benjamin Spencer, of my corps, son to the Rev. Dr. Spencer near
Birmingham, a youth of the most promising hopes, and the sweetest
manners, fell on board the Edgar, a ship that was peculiarly
distinguished, as did Lieutenant Henry Long, in the Isis, who was
likewise much esteemed for a benignity of temper; Lieutenants
Charles Meredith and James Marrie were also wounded.</p>

<p>In consequence of this signal victory, a merited testimony was
conferred upon Captain Lambrecht, of Marines, by the brevet rank
of Major, which could not have been bestowed upon a more worthy
or meritorious member. It was his fortune to be Senior Officer on
board that part of the grand force which was engaged, and to serve in
the Defiance, under the flag of Rear Admiral Graves.</p>

<p>Every man in the English fleet was honored with the Thanks of
his Country, its intrepid leaders received suitable distinctions, and
all stand registered upon the memorials of indelible fame. The
noble Society of Lloyd's stretched forth, likewise, their liberal aids
to the unfortunate sufferers at Copenhagen. Other incidents tended
to accelerate the dissolution of this formidable league; in which a
guardian Providence may be clearly retraced, and our natural
bulwarks as having been the secondary agents of his will.</p>

<p>Early in this year Earl St. Vincent, who had commanded in the
Mediterranean and the Channel, with so much advantage to the
public, and with such Ã©clat to himself, was placed at the helm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Naval affairs. My corps looked up to him as a father and a friend,
and those endearing titles have been fully realized towards us in
every arrangement that has emanated from his intelligent and
comprehensive mind. As we never forsook him in the day of trial,
so we never shall forget him when he is laid low in the dust.</p>

<p>The same spirit for dashing at every thing within the enemy's
ports, and on their coasts still continued to prevail. Three boats
from the Trent, led on by Lieutenants Chamberlayne, Scallion,
Bellamy, Tate, of Marines, and Mr. Hoskins, on the 3d of April,
in opposition to numerous batteries on the shore, the constant fire of
a lugger and cutter, and the aid of a number of small craft, boldly
attacked and drove the lugger amongst the rocks, besides some of
the boats.</p>

<p>Lieutenants Chamberlayne and Tate afterwards boarded and
carried off a large ship which was under their convoy, and what was
their main object, on her way from Brehat to Plampoul. In that
service Lieutenant Tate, of my corps, unfortunately lost a leg.</p>

<p>One of the most daring attempts, ever conceived, was originally
undertaken by Lieutenant Losack, but finally executed by Lieutenant
Maxwell, against the French corvette La Chevrette, in presence of
the combined fleets in the road of Brest, under protection of the
batteries of Camerat, and in spite of nearly 400 men of which her
crew was composed, all ready to oppose the assailants. Upon this
perilous duty Lieutenants Sinclair and Rose, of Marines, spiritedly
volunteered. From the strong position of the enemy, who set every
attack at defiance, no better contested affair occurred through the
whole of this glorious war. Lieutenant Sinclair who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
formerly wounded upon a similar enterprize, was slain in the act
of warding off a like destiny from a Midshipman of the Doris. He
would have done honor to any rank in life.</p>

<p>The carnage was great on the side of the republicans, being above
150 killed and wounded, while that of the British exceeded 66.
Lieutenant W. Burke, an Officer of the highest hopes, received a
mortal wound, and Lieutenant Neville was hurt.</p>

<p>Mr. (now Captain) Maxwell, with all his intrepid companions,
will long appear conspicuous on the records of fame. Capt. Charles
Brisbane says, "Any comments of mine would fall far short of the
merits due to those gallant Officers, Seamen, and Marines
employed on this service." Such examples of irresistible heroism
in subordinate warfare, must have a permanent influence on the
feelings of our enemies upon whatever scale they may be opposed to us.</p>

<p>On the 4th of August a successful bombardment took place
against the French flotilla off Boulogne, and the attack was renewed
upon the 13th by the boats of Lord Nelson's squadron. Although
assembled for the avowed purpose of invading our isles, still the
event of that night plainly shewed that their preparations had been
distinguished much more by steps for self preservation, than for
offensive measures, for our brave fellows, after the strongest feats of
valour, were obliged to abandon their hard earned prizes, from their
having been fastened by chains, or hard on the shore. The issue
was unfortunate, but it added to the glory of the British arms. One
hundred and seventy two Officers, Seamen, and Marines were killed
and wounded in this patriotic attempt. Such were the exertions of
all that the thanks of Earl St. Vincent, and of their brave Chief, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
expressed to every class in the squadron. The service was deprived
of a gallant Officer in Captain Parker of the Navy, and Captain
Young, of my corps, was badly wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gerrard, of Marines, was again a volunteer in cutting
out some vessels of force, from the port of Corunna, happily without
loss.</p>

<p>Admiral Cornwallis, with that perseverance so peculiar to his
character, continued to block up the combined fleets in Brest, who
continued a useless load of expenditure to France and Spain, until
a cessation of arms gave them freedom.</p>

<p>I bitterly lament that I cannot bid farewell to the domestic events
of the present year without diverging upon that baneful spirit of
mutiny, which again broke forth in a detachment of our fleet on the
coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>It first burst out on board the Temeraire, a ship hitherto noted for
good order, and commanded by men who yielded to none in the
British Navy, for talents or humanity. It was a renewal of the same
foul game that was played at the close of the American war, but it
was subverted in a different manner, and with a manly energy,
which bids fair to advance the future interests of discipline. The
party of Marines, under Captain Vallock, after resisting all the
efforts of seduction from their duty, behaved with the fidelity of good
Soldiers, and nobly seconded the firm resolution of Admiral Campbell
and the Officers under his command. As must ever be the case, this
little phalanx, inspired with all the consciousness of a good cause,
quickly overcame their guilty opponents, whose ringleaders expiated
their crimes by an untimely death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The address which those unfortunate men left behind them to
their misguided ship-mates, bespoke the deepest contrition, and affords
the most impressive lesson to the wretch who may ever be so
unguarded as to admit the inroads of discord or disobedience.</p>

<p>In justice to those parties of Marines who loyally avowed their
principles during such commotions, which, indeed, were general, and
the same amongst every detachment in the squadron, I annex copies
of letters from two under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Tench,
and Captain Forshall, directed to those Officers.</p>

<p class="pad2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"We, the Non-Commissioned Officers and Privates, serving as
Marines, under your command, on board his Majesty's ship
Princess Royal, <i>having heard with pleasure</i>, the gallant conduct
of our brother Soldiers on board the Temeraire, and, therefore,
beg leave to express alike with them, our determination to oppose,
with all our might and power, all unlawful combinations and our
readiness to obey our Officers night and day.</p>

<p class="pad2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I hope you will pardon the liberty we take in addressing you,
but as we understand that some ships companies have disobeyed the
just commands of their Officers, and knowing the dreadful
consequences that formerly attended similar practices. For our
parts we abhor the idea, and we hope you will inform Captain
Gardiner, likewise the Admiral, that it is our firm resolution, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
support and maintain our Officers in any thing which they may
think proper, and in that which is best calculated to promote the
interest of our King and Country. I have the honor of subscribing
myself, in behalf of the detachment of Marines,</p>

<p class="right padr2">"Your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">"William Heans, Serjeant.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Captain Forshall, Marines."</p>

<p>The steady allegiance of my corps was such, throughout this
period of indiscipline, that the following testimonies were the
honorable result: "The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty
having expressed their high satisfaction of the good conduct of the
Marines of several ships, under my command with you at
Beerhaven, in declaring their abhorrence of the mutinous proceedings
which had lately taken place at the anchorage, and of their
having come forth on that occasion, so much to the honor of their
Corps, and interests of their Country, I am to desire you will be
pleased to communicate the same to them, and assure them that I
feel highly gratified on the present occasion.</p>

<p class="right">"(Signed) William Cornwallis.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Vice Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>In consequence of the above very handsome communication from
Admiral Cornwallis, Commander in Chief of the Channel Fleet, Sir
Andrew Mitchell issued the following order:</p>

<p>"It is my directions to the Captains of the ships, named in the
margin,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> under my orders, to communicate to the Marines, serving
on board the respective ships under their command, the above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
letter from the Commander in Chief, and I feel equally happy
their good conduct has merited such a mark of approbation from
him and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.</p>

<p class="right">"(Signed) A. Mitchell.</p>

<p class="noindent">"29th December, 1801."</p>

<p>Much to the credit of the Formidable, Captain Grindall, that
ship was totally exempt from the diabolical spirit, and it is proper to
be remarked that the thanks of the Board of Admiralty were withheld
from the parties of Marines in the Vengeance and Resolution, entirely
through mistake, as both were truly entitled to them, for a similar
zeal, with the rest of their brother Soldiers.</p>

<p>I now bid adieu to the domestic transactions of 1801, and hasten
to those quarters of the world, where the British character appears in
all its manly and native vigour, not palsied by murmurs, but
invincible by discipline.</p>

<p>After the desertion of Buonaparte from his Egyptian Army, and
the annulment of the Treaty of El Arisch, the genius of Kleber, his
successor, retrieved every thing. By the battle of Heliopolis he
eventually drove the Turks across the desert to seek refuge in Gaza,
recaptured Cairo, which had been formerly evacuated, and by a
train of good policy as well as a system of judicious defence, rendered
the French power in Egypt more firm than ever. But a dark assassin
deprived their Army of this distinguished leader, after whose tragical
death, the chief command devolved upon General Menou, who
following the footsteps of his predecessors, and by a peculiar assimilation
to the tenets and manners of the Mahometans, seemed to have
resolved upon fixing a permanent Empire in Lower Egypt. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
rejected, with disdain, every overture towards a renewal of the Treaty
of El Arisch, and, excepting a number of Greeks embodied under the
auspices of Kleber, who were trained in European tactics, rested all
his hopes of defence against native inroads, or foreign invaders, in
the remnants of his countrymen.</p>

<p>It was reserved for a branch of my corps, combined with a British
Army, to assist in rooting out this powerful force, to restore those
conquered dominions to their rightful Lord, and thus to close a war
by subduing those motives of ambition which had continued to
cherish it.</p>

<p>A very considerable armament, which had been employed on
other services during the last year, had entered the Mediterranean,
and the troops who formed a part of it, were landed at Malta and
Minorca. These were destined to expel the French from Egypt, in
co-operation with an Army, under General Baird, from the regions of
India, and an Ottoman force, under the Grand Vizier, which was to
cross the deserts of Syria.</p>

<p>Lord Keith, with the English fleet, rendezvoused early in January
1801, in the Bay of Marmorice, on the coast of Caramania,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> where
preparations, necessary for the intended expedition, were carried on.
Two days previous to their sailing for Egypt, his Lordship signified
his directions to Lieutenant Colonel Smith, who commanded the
Marines, to hold himself in readiness to disembark with the Officers
and men from the different ships, and to place himself under the
orders of General Sir Ralph Abercrombie; at the same time vesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
him with a power of issuing such preparatory instructions as he might
deem proper for the future regulations of his battalion.</p>

<p>Upon the 23d of February the fleet steered for the coast of Egypt,
conveying an army of 15,330 Soldiers, and anchored in the auspicious
Bay of Aboukir, on the 2d of March. An incessant gale prevented
any debarkation until the 8th, when a landing was effected by the
greater part of the Army, under circumstances that very signally
attested their discipline and their valour. The Officers and Seamen
of the fleet had likewise their share of these attached merits. This
important object having been accomplished, Sir Ralph Abercrombie
advanced to within six miles of Alexandria, and three of the enemy,
who were strongly posted on a ridge, with the canal of that city on
their right flank and the sea on their left.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the arrangement that had been made in the Bay of
Marmorice, and by the order of battle given out, the
Marines were attached to the 3d brigade under Lord Cavan, and
united in it with the 50th and 79th Regiments.</p>

<p>Previous to the landing of the Marines, Lord Keith addressed the
following letter to Lieutenant Colonel Smith:</p>

<p class="right">"Foudroyant, in Bay of Aboukir, 9th March, 1801.</p>

<p class="pad2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"If it shall be requisite to land the Marines from some of the
ships for a short time, I beg you will furnish me with the arrangements
you have made, and the temporary ranks necessary to be
given, so that I may furnish the Officers with authority.</p>

<p class="right padr2">"I am, Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">"(Signed,) Keith.</p>

<p class="negidt2">"Lieut.-Col. Smith, Marine Forces,<br />
his Majesty's ship Kent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>In consequence, many Officers obtained brevet rank, in the course
of the Egyptian campaign, and received additional pay according to
the proportions of each.</p>

<p>An institution alike liberal and just was adopted by Lord Keith
towards the Marine Corps, that while its Officers and Soldiers were
employed on shore, in advancing the interests of their Country, their
claims for prize-money were considered as valid during the whole
period of their absence.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the 12th of March, that the Marines of
the fleet were landed in the Bay of Aboukir, consisting of 35 serjeants,
32 corporals, 22 drummers, and 500 privates, besides Officers. It
may be well conceived how difficult, yet how honorable was the duty
of fitting, for immediate service, this heterogeneous body, drawn from
30 different ships, unknown to one another, and a great many of
them totally ignorant of every military evolution. The battalion,
however, was formed between the hours of 12 and 3 upon that day,
under a scorching sun, and on a burning sand, after which one half
was detached to fill bags for the batteries, whilst the other was
marched a considerable distance, all the while nearly knee-deep in
sand, and laden with their comrades musquets and knapsacks. After
such labours, during the day, orders arrived at seven in the evening
for the whole to join the main body of the Army, then 15 miles
distant, which they effected, after much fatigue, at one on the
morning of the 13th of March. At five they were again under arms,
with a view to have attacked the enemy, advancing towards him in
two lines by the left, in order to have turned his right flank. But
anticipating the movements of the British, he descended from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
heights which he had occupied, and struck at the leading brigades
of both our lines. The battle began on the right at seven, and those
on the left instantly formed.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that this detachment of my corps, hitherto
untrained to military tactics, could evince that regularity and precision
in manÅuvre which so much distinguished those veteran Soldiers
with whom they served. But if they failed in the minutiÃ¦ of
discipline, they were not behind them in valour. The engagement
becoming warm and general, they were somewhat crouded in their
ranks by the alignment of the regiments on their right and left, owing
to the narrowing of the Peninsula upon which they acted, and at the
moment when they sustained their severest loss. Although not
perfectly regular to command, they still, under a gallant impulse,
rushed forward in charge towards the enemy, and acquired, for their
conspicuous bravery, the appellation of the <i>Bull Dogs</i> of the Army.
The French were driven at last, with an irresistible impetuosity, to
take shelter under the fortified heights, that constitute the chief
defence of Alexandria.</p>

<p>The details of loss were fully proportionate to those of their
brethren in arms, being 2 Officers and 22 rank and file killed, 4
Officers, 2 Serjeants, 2 Drummers, and 27 rank and file wounded.
Amongst the former were Lieutenants Paul Hussey, and Linzee Shea,
holding rank as Captains in the Marine battalion, and Captain Minto,
with that of brevet as Major, besides Captain Robert Torkington, 1st
Lieutenant John Parry, and 2d Lieutenant George Peebles.</p>

<p>Upon the day after the battle the following were the public
orders issued by the Commander in Chief, who had intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
to Lord Keith the gallantry of the Marines upon that
occasion:</p>

<p class="right">"Camp, 4 miles from Alexandria, 14 March, 1801.</p>

<p>"Sir Ralph Abercrombie desires that Lieutenant Colonel Smith
and the battalion of Marines, will accept his Thanks for their
conduct, in the course of the service of yesterday; at the request
of Lord Keith.</p>

<p>"The Commander in Chief has the greatest satisfaction in
thanking the troops for their soldier-like conduct in the action
of yesterday."</p>

<p>In the afternoon the battalion marched to Aboukir, where they
were placed under the command of Earl Dalhousie, and remained
there some time after the surrender of its Castle.</p>

<p>Those brave fellows were truly sensible of their defect in point
of discipline, but a generous spirit of emulation pervaded the whole
of them, and under the able superintendance of Lieutenant Colonel
Smith, and Major Minto, this mixed body of men, in a very few days,
might have vied with any regiment in the field. They meritedly
gained, and repeatedly obtained from the Commander in Chief and
Major General Coote, under whom they were brigaded, the highest
encomiums for their soldier like appearance, steady conduct, and
the good order of their encampment, when in front of Alexandria.
It was their destiny to be entrusted with the defence of Aboukir Castle,
and its vicinity, which precluded them from displaying their rapid
improvement in evolution, or of sharing in the laurels acquired by
the Army, on the glorious 21st of March; a day upon which every
British Soldier may well exult, but not without mingling with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
proud joy, an unfeigned sigh over the memory of that great and good
man who led, and whose honorable life was sacrificed at the shrine
of victory.</p>

<p>The Marines, as constituting a material proportion of the strength
of Lord Keith's fleet, formed no part of these detachments which
penetrated the interior, but their duties were confined to the blockade
of Alexandria, where they might be ready to re-embark in case of
emergency, at the shortest notice.</p>

<p>The brilliant details of the Egyptian Campaign, are well known
to the world. They have been given in a stile highly adapted to
yield general information, and to rouse, within our Armies, an
emulous zeal.</p>

<p>If it was not the lot of my corps to stand on the annals of splendor
by an active co-operation with those bodies who conquered Rosetta,
Rhamanich, and Cairo, still their effective presence tended to
enable the Commander in Chief to achieve these distant and important
objects. Attached to the brigade of Major General Coote, they were
withdrawn from the defence of Aboukir, and continued to discharge,
with an unrelaxed discipline, the duties of investment, with but
little variety, until the 5th day of August, when the previous arrival
of reinforcements from England and India, the return of the forces
from the recovery of the internal posts in Lower Egypt, and
at the express desire of Lord Keith, they were struck off the
shore details, and next day were re-embarked on board their respective
ships.</p>

<p>With such an accumulated Army General (now Lord) Hutchinson
was empowered to push the siege of Alexandria, which was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
on with so great ability and success, that it surrendered on the 30th
of August.</p>

<p>It would be a wide attempt for me to embrace a discussion of those
movements that led to the expulsion of the French from Egypt, and
I am too humble by any panegyric of mine, to add a single mite to
the well earned fame of those distinguished Officers, those intrepid
Soldiers and Seamen, by whose united talents and valour, such
momentous results were obtained. Every individual is registered
upon the grateful records of his Country, carries about with him a
memorial of his own deeds, which reminds him and every one of his
military comrades, that an Englishman is as terrible in the field, as
he is upon the ocean.</p>

<p>The solid merits of my corps were such that I cannot omit the
following high testimonials, which bespeak them in much more
forcible terms, than any I can advance:</p>

<p class="right">"Foudroyant, Bay of Aboukir, 5th July, 1801.</p>

Army on the coast of Egypt, and I have to request that you will,
with the permission of Major General Coote, communicate the
approbation which their Lordships have been pleased to express to

<p>Major General Coote having received a similar letter from his
Lordship, enclosed it to Colonel Smith, at the same time giving his
sanction for its contents being published to the Officers and men of
the Marine battalion.</p>

<p>Three days previous to their embarkation the Major General
thus expressed himself:</p>

<p class="right">"Camp, near Alexandria, 3d August, 1801.</p>

John Hely Hutchinson's directions, that the battalion of Marines,
under your command, is to hold itself in readiness to return on
board their respective ships. I cannot, however, suffer you to
leave the division of the Army, without assuring you how perfectly
satisfied I am, with the attention you have always paid to the
Marines. The good conduct of your corps, whilst under my
orders, does them the greatest credit, and I beg you will be so
obliging as to signify the same both to your Officers and men.</p>

<p>They having done duty under Major General Finch, during a
time, in the 1st Brigade, that Officer, in consequence, thus conveys
his sentiments:</p>

<p class="right">"Brigade Orders, August 5, 1801.</p>

<p>"Major General Finch, on taking leave of Lieutenant Colonel
Smith and the Marines under his command, requests him to accept
his warmest thanks for the order, regularity, zeal, and attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
that have uniformly marked their conduct during the period he
had the honor of commanding the 1st Brigade, and he shall be
happy on all occasions to bear testimony to their merit in the
correct performance of their duty, in every respect, which has
come under his observation."</p>

<p>Although ulterior in date still, for the sake of connection, I am
led to insert the very flattering encomiums of Lord Hutchinson, the
Commander in Chief.</p>

<p class="right">"Jermyn Street, June 28, 1802.</p>

<p class="pad2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Your sudden departure from Egypt rendered it impossible for
me to desire that you would communicate my thanks to the
Marines who served under your command during the campaign.
May I now beg that you will assure the Officers and men, how
highly sensible I am of their meritorious services, and of the zeal
and exertion which ever marked their conduct. The order and
discipline preserved by the battalion does great credit to your
military character, and is equally honorable to the respectable
corps which you had the good fortune to command.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Lieut.-Col. Smith, Royal Marines."</p>

<p>Owing to some omission, the medals which were bestowed by
the Grand Signior upon every Officer of the Army, as commemorative
of his gratitude, and of their services during the Egyptian campaign,
were for a time withheld from those of the corps of Royal Marines,
but in consequence of Lord Keith's representation of it to the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Elgin, our Ambassador at the Ottoman Porte, his Sublime Highness
most readily compensated for this error, and these honorable marks
were conveyed to Sir Richard Bickerton, commanding the British
Naval Forces at Malta, who transmitted them along with a letter
couched in the following elegant terms:</p>

<p class="right">"Kent, at Malta, March 18th, 1803.</p>

<p class="pad2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have the honor of forwarding to you some Turkish medals,
to be distributed among the Officers of Marines who served on
shore, and in the squadron employed in the blockade of
Alexandria, during the Egyptian campaign.</p>

<p>"The accompanying letter and list,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> will explain every thing;
it therefore only remains for me to add, that I feel a pleasure in
having been made a medium in conveying what may be acceptable
to a small part of your corps; and I should be much more gratified
if it was in my power to congratulate you <i>on the acquisition of
more substantial advantages for the whole</i>, being every day more
fully convinced of its services and utility.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Lieut.-Col. Smith, Royal Marines."</p>

<p>Our victorious armies and fleet, which were destined for other
services, were suddenly stayed by the tidings of a cessation of arms.</p>

<p>The feats of our squadrons and ships in the Mediterranean lost
none of their wonted splendor. Sir James Saumarez's attack upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the French squadron, under the numerous batteries of Algeziras,
yields to no one upon record, for boldness of design or spirit in
execution. Although the event of the 6th of July was unprosperous,
still the gallantry exhibited on that day was productive of the most
signal consequences, and it, no doubt, had its effect upon a superior
force, who, panic struck, felt the retaliating vengeance of Sir James
and his little detachment, on the 12th. In the first action 375
Seamen and Marines were killed, wounded, and missing; amongst
the former detail was 1st Lieutenant J. D. Williams, on board the
Hannibal, who behaved with true British courage, and with the latter
were numbered Lieutenants George Dunford and J. W. Day, of
Marines.</p>

<p>Sir James Saumarez, after speaking of the bravery of the men under
his command, says, "that Captain Maxwell and the Officers of my
corps on board the Cesar, were entitled to much praise." Captain
Keates of the Superbe, whose personal intrepidity and zeal were
highly instrumental in gaining the victory of the 12th of July, by
capturing the St. Antonio, thus acknowledges the merits of his crew
to the Commander in Chief: "It is my duty to represent to you,
that the Officers of all descriptions, Seamen, and Marines,
conducted themselves with the greatest steadiness and gallantry."</p>

<p>The bravery of Captain Hood, his Officers, Seamen, and Marines
was also highly conspicuous. A branch of my corps was again
included in the legislative thanks of a grateful Country, and Sir
James Saumarez, whose name is superior to panegyric, deservedly
was crowned with honorary, as well as pecuniary marks of his
Sovereign's favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>The action of the PhÅbe, Captain Barlow, with L'Africaine
French frigate was marked by an immense carnage, and afforded
an evident display of superior discipline in the Sailors and Marines
under his orders. That Officer was deservedly knighted after her
capture.</p>

<p>Lord Cochrane in the Speedy, who was nobly supported by all
his followers, gave early hopes of what may yet be expected from
him by his Country, by boarding and carrying the frigate Gamo of
32 guns and 319 men, while his own force was only 14 guns and
54 men.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilson, of Marines, with his party from the Mercury,
was noticed by Captain Rogers, for their courage and good conduct,
first in boarding a French Pirate amongst the rocks in the Tremite
Islands, and afterwards driving her renegado crew from the hills
which they occupied, with a four pounder gun and musquetry.
Lieutenant Wilson covered Lieutenant Mather and the Seamen while
heaving the vessel off the rocks, and then re-embarked with some
prisoners.</p>

<p>Those Officers had been highly distinguished upon a former
occasion in bringing his Majesty's late sloop, the Bull Dog, from the
port of Ancona under a heavy fire of cannon and musquetry from the
Mole, but they were obliged to abandon her to the enemy from an
insetting current, and a calm, after all their gallant efforts. This
ship was reserved for a future but more successful attempt by the
Seamen and Marines of the Champion, who bravely assaulted her,
and brought her out from under the guns of Gallipoli, guided by the
daring zeal of Lord William Stuart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>The Swiftsure of 74 guns fell into the hands of Admiral
Gantheaume's squadron; after a resistance which reflected honor
upon Captain Hallowell, his subordinates, and the British Navy.</p>

<p>Lord Cochrane, in union with Captain Pulling, again gave a test
of intrepidity, by striking at a Spanish convoy in the Bay of Orepeso,
protected by a castle, a xebeck, and gunboats. These they destroyed
with little loss.</p>

<p>In August Captain Halsted's squadron took La Caniere of 44
guns, after a short action. Lieutenant Douglas, of Marines, was
wounded, but died after amputation on board La Pomone. This
frigate was on her way with a convoy, having stores and ammunition
on board, for the French Army then carrying on the siege of Porto
Ferrajo, in the Isle of Elba.</p>

<p>This little fortress disdaining to participate in that terror which
had disgraced the continent of Italy, afforded refuge to Mr. Isaac
Grant, English Vice Consul at Leghorn, and others of his countrymen,
who fled from our rapacious enemies on their entrance into Tuscany.
His example and precepts roused the natives to arms, while the very
females shared in the patriotic impulse of defending their families
and their Country, from those universal spoilers. Mingled with
its garrison, were Lieutenant Lawrence and his party of Marines
from the Pearl, whose animated efforts, during a long series of six
months fatigue and danger, are little known, but were such as to
entitle the whole to the highest praise. This little force, by their
constancy and courage, ever set the best of examples, were always
foremost on service, and stood to their post and guns when the Tuscan
and other foreign troops gave way. They were likewise unremittingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
useful in preparing shells, mounting and transporting cannon, and
in repairing their carriages, as well as constructing works. Their
knowledge of gunnery, acquired by experience in a long siege, and
their ambition to gain honor to their corps and themselves, induced
them to live in the batteries, and the little sleep which they enjoyed,
was by their cannon. Such zealous perseverance impaired the healths
of this brave detachment, and if the place had not been relieved by
other troops, Lieutenant Lawrence and his faithful companions must
have fallen victims to incessant toil.</p>

<p>The merits of Colonel Airey, in the defence of Porto Ferrajo,
were great indeed. Nothing could surpass his cool judgment and
spirited exertions in foiling a very superior enemy in all their
attempts. The bravery and good conduct of Mr. Isaac Grant, in
repeated sallies, were eminently conspicuous. Few occasions have
exhibited a more manly patience, or a nobler stand.</p>

<p>Upon the 12th of September Sir John Warren appeared with his
squadron to relieve this brave garrison. He had previously given an
order to Captain John Richardson, of Marines, to act as Brigade
Major to Lieutenant Colonel Airey, and he was disembarked, as
well as Captain Johnstone, from the Gibraltar, 12 Subalterns, 17
Serjeants, 18 Corporals, 11 Drummers, and 390 Privates. A
force of 240 Seamen was also landed under Captain Long of the
Royal Navy. Captain James Weir, (now on retirement), who
commanded the Marines at Malta, served in Porto Ferrajo at the
head of a Maltese corps, with distinguished reputation.</p>

<p>It having been resolved to destroy the enemy's works, a debarkation
of upwards of 1000 men took place early on the morning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
14th of September, while a sortie from the garrison was attempted
against the battery which overawed the harbour. Captain Long,
with his division of Seamen, Marines, and Swiss, proceeded to
demolish the batteries on the right side of the bay, which he
performed in a gallant stile. That Officer was shot through the
shoulder very early in the action, but persevered in the attack, until
his little advanced party, consisting of 26 Seamen and Marines,
reached a spot where the enemy had a field piece, and were in
considerable force. It was within 18 yards of their position that this
brave young man received a mortal wound, when he was carried
from the field. He lingered and died, and so strongly impressed
was the foe with admiration of his valor, that a suspension of arms
was maintained, while his remains were borne, with military honors,
to the grave. Lieutenant Campbell, of Marines, after this mishap,
instantly charged, drove the republicans to a narrow pass, where,
being reinforced, he was held in check; but having accomplished
the chief object which was intended, he effected a retreat to
the garrison.</p>

<p>Captains Johnstone and Richardson, who headed the division
against the enemy's works on the left side of the harbour, did every
thing that could have been expected from brave and experienced
Officers. After having ruined the batteries of Punta Pina, the
grottoes, and giovanni, a vast quantity of ammunition, and having
carried off 150 barrels of powder, the British and Allied troops
were attacked by very superior numbers in different quarters. Under
existing circumstances a retreat was the only expedient, which, after
a spirited contest, was made to the boats and within the walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
fortress. Lieut. Clarke, of Marines, was wounded and made prisoner.
The general loss was by no means equal to the nature of this service.
Colonel Airey expressed himself highly indebted for the support and
assistance given by the Seamen and Marines. Although the
inadequacy of numbers prevented the completion of every object,
still this diversion afforded a temporary aid to the brave defenders of
Porto Ferrajo.</p>

<p>Major Weir signalized himself in a subsequent sortie on the night
of the 10th of October, and the garrison never relaxed in the most
animated perseverance, until peace threw open its gates to a new
sovereign. Captain Halsted, previous to the appearance of Sir John
Warren, had captured or destroyed the whole of the French
blockading squadron.</p>

<p>Those Northern Powers, against whom Britain had reluctantly
drawn the sword, experienced a severe and early chastisement in the
loss of all their West India Colonies, which successively yielded to
the prompt and vigorous measures of Admiral Duckworth and Sir
Thomas Trigge. St. Bartholomew's, St. Martin's, which alone
offered any resistance, St. Thomas, and Santa Cruz submitted to the
Army and Fleet during the month of March, and the islands of St.
Eustatius and Saba were occupied by our forces in April. These
conquests afforded no field for achievement, but they gave opportunities
for the display of much united zeal.</p>

<p>Captains Manby and Butcher, their Officers, Seamen, and
Marines were noticed for gallant single actions, and Lieutenant
Mackenzie, with those under him, for much intrepidity in cutting out
a schooner from under the batteries at Guadaloupe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>It is with a heartfelt pain that I am constrained to blend with
these honorable details, another instance of baneful insubordination
which occurred on board the Castor frigate, upon Sunday the 13th
of December. The trying hour produced another example of steady
fidelity in Lieutenant J. S. Smith and his loyal party of Marines.
Captain Fanshawe upon observing the first symptoms of revolt,
ordered the detachment under arms, which was obeyed with an
unsurpassed alacrity. The young but spirited Officer, who headed
them, needed no prompter to a decisive conduct. He, with an
unlooked for rapidity, charged bayonets, drove the guilty criminals
to the larboard side of the lower deck, where, cooped up, they were
forced to surrender their ringleaders.</p>

<p>The heroic feelings of a private Marine, who was confined to his
hammock at the outset of this commotion, would have done honor to
any age of the world. Though depressed with fever, still he arose,
put on his accoutrements, took his musquet and his post in the ranks.
On being questioned why he was there, he nobly replied to his Officer,
"Oh, Sir, this is not a time to be sick." This action obtained for
him a subsequent promotion, and on retrospect, it still merits a
pecuniary tribute. It is under the impulse of cordial esteem, as well
as of public justice, that I annex the very flattering testimony of the
Court Martial, which sat upon those deluded mutineers, respecting
the firm conduct of Lieutenant Smith and his party. Captain
Western, the President, addressed him in these words: "I have it
in command from this Court to express to you the high sense they
entertain of your very Officer like conduct on the evening of the
13th of December, and the good and steady conduct of the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of Marines embarked under your orders. Your prompt and
spirited execution of Captain Fanshawe's orders appears to the
Court to have stopped a very dangerous mutiny, and the token of
their approbation of your conduct will be transmitted to the
Commander in Chief, and inserted in the minutes of the Court
Martial." This became much enhanced by the following very
judicious and handsome order from Admiral Duckworth:</p>

<p class="right">"Southampton, Fort Royal Bay, 26th December, 1801.</p>

<p>"Memorandum&mdash;Whereas the members of the Court Martial on
the mutineers of his Majesty's ship Castor, have felt called
upon, in justice to the exemplary and meritorious conduct of
Lieutenant J. S. Smith, of the Marines, and the party under his
command, to express their high sense of such spirited behaviour.</p>

<p>"It is my directions that these sentiments of the Court are read
on board his Majesty's ship under my orders, to testify how fully I
accord with the Court in the commendation so deservedly
bestowed.</p>

<p class="right">"(Signed) J. S. DUCKWORTH."</p>

<p>Early in 1801 Lieut. Vyvian, of my corps, fell in a gallant attempt
to bring out two vessels, at anchor, within the bar of Senegal, protected
by heavy batteries on the shore. Nothing could exceed the obstinate
courage of all under Lieutenant Dick, who commanded in the attack.
After twenty minutes contest they carried his Majesty's late sloop the
Senegal, which they were obliged to destroy, and with much
difficulty the boats effected a retreat across a tremendous surf, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
exposed to a dreadful discharge of grape shot. This success was
dearly purchased with the lives of Lieutenant Palmer, 1 Midshipman,
and 8 Seamen and Marines. Lieutenant Vyvian left not behind him
his superior for promising talents, or correct manners.</p>

<p>Two very gallant actions were fought in the East, which did
honor to Captains Adam, of La Sybille, and G. R. Collier, of the
Victor. La Chiffone and La Fleche yielded to the discipline and
valour of British Seamen and Marines, which were exemplified in
a striking degree, by each ship having been opposed to batteries
on the shore, intricate shoals during the battle, and to an equal
force in those antagonists which they combated.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred upon the station of Jamaica. Society had to
deplore the loss of one of its most valuable members, and the Royal
Navy one of its brightest ornaments, in Lord Hugh Seymour, the
Commander in Chief.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he wide and important interests to be discussed, necessarily
protracted the desirable event of a Definitive Peace, during which
anxious interval both nations rested on their arms.</p>

<p>The powerful detachments of our republican neighbours, to the
western world, could not be viewed by a vigilant Ministry, but
with a jealous eye, whom it behoved to push a force adequate to
counteract their schemes, if directed against our Colonies. Such
mighty armaments taking their departure for a distant quarter, during
pending negociations, had doubtless an influence in spinning them
out, and it was not until the 27th of March, 1802, that this salutary
work was consummated; a day which diffused a general joy
through each rival land.</p>

<p>Public gratitude did not cool after the return of tranquillity, but
with an enlightened policy, as well as a liberal justice, it embraced
and anticipated the wants and feelings of those brave men who had
vindicated their Country's honor, her glory, and independence.</p>

<p>Many revolving years had witnessed the distinguished gallantry,
the unimpaired loyalty of the corps of Marines; the records of a
British Legislature had long teemed with grateful memorials of their
merits upon the shores, and the ocean of every clime, but with
scarcely one solid mark of recompence for all their brilliant services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>It was reserved for the year 1802, and the ministerial auspices of
Earl St. Vincent, to draw this body of faithful Soldiers into a close
alliance with a family and a throne, for which they had so often
bled, and round whom they will rally to the latest period of their
existence. The title of <i>Royal</i> was not the acquirement of influence.
No! it was the gain of more than one hundred years of undiminished
zeal; a Monarch's tributary sacrifice at the altar of honor! It is a
sacred appellation which, I trust, we will not sully, and what we
never will surrender into any hands, without a glorious struggle, but
into those of a branch of that Illustrious House, from which we
received it. A Sovereign's favor cheers the Soldier, soothes all
his past sufferings, and cares, and turns his eyes to future glory
alone.</p>

<p>The boon was accepted by the Marine Corps with all the
manliness of conscious desert, and with a thankful exultation.</p>

<p>It was conveyed, in the following terms, from Sir Evan Nepean,
to Lieutenant General Souter Johnstone, Commandant in Chief:</p>

<p class="right">"Admiralty Office, April 29, 1802.</p>

<p class="pad2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"The Earl St. Vincent having signified, to my Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that his Majesty, in order to mark
his Royal approbation of the very meritorious conduct of the corps

to direct that, in future, the corps shall be styled "The Royal
Marines."</p>

<p>"I have great satisfaction in obeying their Lordships commands
to communicate this intelligence to you; and in offering their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
Lordships congratulations on this testimony of the opinion his

<p>A respectable and effective force of 100 companies, was the peace
establishment, and subsequent events have realized the wisdom of
that measure.</p>

<p>The retired list was also considerably augmented, which yielded
a retreat, not only to the worn out veteran, but likewise to those
who could identify an incapacity for future service. Every necessary
reference as to the former and present details of the corps, may be had
to that list which is annually issued from the Board of Admiralty,
upon the 1st of January, and is in the hands of almost every
Officer.</p>

<p>Although hostility had ceased in every quarter, still the Marine
Soldier was oftener than once conspicuous upon the annals of the year,
by a steady fidelity and valour.</p>

<p>A very dangerous insurrection of the 8th West India regiment
in the island of Dominica, marked by circumstances of the most
shocking barbarity, was checked in its immediate effects, in part, by
his firm countenance. It fortunately occurred, when those murderous
revolters first shewed their spirit, that his Majesty's ship Magnificent
was at anchor in Prince Rupert's Bay. Some shot, from the Lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Cabareta, which went over her, was the first symptom of mutiny
on the shore, and it was soon confirmed by intelligence that the
Blacks had risen in arms, and had assassinated a number of their
Officers. Captain Gifford tendered his services to the President of
the island, who, conceiving it only the prelude to a general commotion,
gladly accepted the offer. Lieutenant O. Neale volunteered
the duty of disembarkation, and he felt it a difficult task to restrain
the ardor of the whole party of Marines, to follow him. But his
number was confined to 2 Serjeants, 2 Corporals, and 36 Privates,
with which he put off from the ship just at dawn on the morning of
the 10th of April. Observing the rebels advancing rapidly to the
beach, he anticipated their object, quickly effected a landing, and
took post on a hill, after the exchange of some scattering shots.
Opposed to nearly 500 Blacks, whom he kept at bay during the
day, reinforcements became necessary, and he was farther
strengthened by two successive detachments of Marines under
Lieutenants Lambert and Hawkins. Upon this rising ground, those
brave fellows, not exceeding 66, gave refuge to many Officers who
flew from the ferocious hands of the mutineers. They were afterwards
joined by some Colonial Militia, who were little calculated,
from the mixed nature of their arms, to oppose a resolute enemy.
The dispositions of Lieutenant Lambert through the night, aided by
the counsels of Mr. O. Neale, were like a good Officer. The
native troops gave way to slumber. His outposts were, therefore,
confided to his faithful companions, and all his energies were derived
from his own brethren. Incessant rains had nearly rendered useless
all their ammunition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following day the Marines were ordered to Grand Ance,
in order to protect the inhabitants, and through that night were
posted in the swamps to prevent the escape of the Blacks from Fort
Shirley. Many of our men had been 56 hours on shore amidst the
greatest privations; having had nothing to eat but raw salt beef and
biscuit. The stagnated smell from their position, pointed out the
necessity of obtaining some other refreshment to recruit nature, and
to avert disease. A Marine of the party, overhearing the discussion
amongst his Officers, nobly said, "I will go to the village and bring
them&mdash;I know I must go and repass the enemy's fire, but my life
is not mine, it is at the constant command of his Majesty's service."
He accordingly performed his duty, and escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>Bread was distributed, and brandy administered, in scanty
portions, through the night, by the Officers, who exhorted the men
to keep up their spirits. The feelings of the brave are ever
reciprocal in acts of kindness. One and all they exclaimed "We
wish to add another laurel to our corps, we will follow you where
ever you go." The mud collected by the rains, had, in the course
of marching, deprived many of their shoes, which could not be
remedied but from the ship. Frequent flags of truce had passed
between General Johnstone and the fort. Mr. Roberts, an Officer
of Engineers, requested to storm it, if the mutineers would not
surrender the barrier, providing the Marines accompanied him, who,
to a man, volunteered, saying, "We don't mind shoes, we can
fight without them." The Governor applauded their gallant zeal,
and assured them of a preference, if their services should be

<p>The Marines united with detachments from the Royal Scotch, and
68th Regiments, marched into the fort upon the 12th, and drew up in
front of the Black Corps, which presented arms to the troops; having
three of their own Officers, as prisoners, placed between their colours.
General Johnstone was obeyed by them in his orders to shoulder,
order, and ground their arms; but on being commanded to step three
paces in front, the cry was "No," they instantly resumed them and
fired a volley: this was returned, and was followed up with a charge
of bayonets, which broke their ranks, and dispersed the mutineers
in every direction. The greater part fled up the Outer Cabaret,
keeping up a fire until they reached the rocks, down which many
precipitated themselves, and those who could afterwards crawl from
the bottom were exposed to a discharge of grape and cannister
from the Magnificent.</p>

<p>John Budd, private Marine, distinguished himself most signally
during the pursuit. He was attacked singly by four black grenadiers,
one of whom he killed with his first fire, wounded another, when
coolly awaiting a return from the other two, reloaded his musquet,
with which he shot a third, and bayoneted the fourth. Afterwards
turning to him who was wounded, he closed his destinies, and
throwing the remains of the whole over the rocks finished his exploit
by saying "This is the way I shall serve all traitors." The conduct
of John Lamswood, and Alexander Livingstone is also worthy of
notice; both were severely wounded, but they persevered in their
duty until the loss of blood, brought them to the ground. The
former received a ball in his mouth, which lodging in his throat, was
afterwards extracted by an able operation of Mr. Veitch, Surgeon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the Saturn. I am authorized likewise to detail the name of John
Batt, private, whose alacrity, during these arduous services, cheered
his associates. As my scope is limited, I would not detract from the
merits of these corps, with which mine was united. Theirs were
such as to maintain their long established reputation. Upon their
return to Martinique, the whole detachment met a mark of public
recompence in those necessaries which they had expended, and the
Officers received the thanks of General Johnstone, and of the
Presidency of Dominique, which they had probably saved from
general revolt.</p>

<p>I wish I could close the year with a more gratifying topic than
that of insubordination, which first shewed its lurking spirit in the
Mediterranean, by the most daring acts. It broke out on board the
Gibraltar, whose crew chose to decide the propriety of fulfilling or
disobeying the orders for their future destination. Attempts of
violence were opposed by the noblest firmness in Captain Johnstone
and his gallant party on board, by whose spirited and prompt
exertions, with those of the Officers, good order was restored, the
flame stifled from spreading farther, and the services of a brave
squadron preserved to their Country at a momentous crisis.</p>

<p>Two of the ringleaders suffered death; upon whose trials the
distinguished merits of the Marine detachment were apparent to
the Court, who gave testimony of their gratitude by inserting them
upon their records. The following communication bespoke, in
suitable terms, the very high sense which the Commander in Chief
entertained of their meritorious conduct, which was read throughout
his fleet.</p>

character of the loyal and respectable corps to which they belong,

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">B</span>esides the many useful reforms adopted by Earl St. Vincent,
for the internal Åconomy of the British Navy, his Lordship also
turned his attention to the corps of Royal Marines. Upon the 18th
of March, 1803, a new code of instructions was published for their
regulation when on shore, which vests in the four Senior Captains
of each division, the management and superintendance of many
concerns that had formerly been placed under separate departments.
It would exceed my bounds to attempt the discussion of arrangements
which are obviously well designed to promote the interests of the
public and the individual, as well as to establish a facility in
subordinate transactions. Experience, doubtless, will attest their
wisdom, and posterity recognize with gratitude their enlightened
author.</p>

<p>The joyous work of peace had scarcely been fulfilled, when
disappointed ambition began to wreak its rancour, through the low
channels of a venal press. Hitherto the organs of knowledge, and
sometimes of liberal opinion, the papers of republican France, under
the controul of its First Consul, became the contemptible interpreters
of degrading scurrility and the most inflammatory philippics against
the English Government. Like the noise of the rattlesnake, they
proclaimed a latent danger, while all the public institutes of
Buonaparte were levelled at the foundations of our commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
greatness. A banditti of unauthorized agents also set themselves
down in our seaports, who, under the specious pretexts of trade,
were commissioned to explore our coasts and to contaminate our
principles. By such subtle means had the courage and the energies
of almost every State which had fallen under the French yoke, been
previously undermined, and they well merited the instant and
retaliating vengeance of a great kingdom. But war is a serious evil,
and every expedient to avert it should be tried by a commercial
Country, ere it has recourse to arms. There can be no compromise,
however, where national security and honor are at stake. Ours were
involved, and we again took up arms in defence of our dearest
birthrights.</p>

<p>My corps very soon met an increase of 43 companies to complete
the legislative vote for 1803. This has introduced to actual service,
all who were upon the half pay list, and produced many vacancies
upon the establishment, which, to the perpetual honor of Earl St.
Vincent, have been filled by the offspring or kindred of the veteran
Marine Officer, who have uniformly met a preference from his
Lordship, to the adopted sons of power.</p>

<p>A detachment under Lieutenant Colonel Collins embarked for
Port Phillips, in the Southern part of New Holland, who was
nominated Lieutenant Governor of it. His personal knowledge of
the Country, and the habitual discipline of my corps, will, I trust,
unitedly render that fertile spot, of future public benefit, and its
society of unfortunate criminals conspicuous by a reform of manners.</p>

<p>Few occasions, during the present war, have offered to signalize
Marine valour. Wherever they have occurred, the most powerful
incentives to the human mind, have been held out to every hero who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
shall imitate such examples. The gallantry of Charles O'Reilly,
private, on board the Loire, who assisted in carrying the national
brig Venteux, and bringing her out from under the heavy batteries
of the Isle of Bas, was condescendingly noticed by the Board of
Admiralty, and he was immediately promoted, by General Averne,
to the rank of Serjeant, at the request of their Lordships. This was
likewise followed by a pecuniary recompence from the society of
Lloyd's; an institution founded in the most noble munificence, the
purest benevolence, and the most exalted patriotism.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Irvin, of Marines, also shewed his zeal in a detached
enterprize from the Naiad, against a French schooner at anchor in
the Saintes, which was achieved without loss.</p>

<p>My narrative here reaches its close, and I will not dive into
futurity. Thus much I will venture to anticipate, that whether in
union with his gallant brethren of the fleet, or blended with our
disciplined Armies on the shore, the Marine Soldier will never
forfeit that distinguished name which he now holds, of loyalty to his
King, fidelity to his Country, and unshaken valour against the
enemies of both.</p>

<p>If such continues to be his virtues, may he never want a patron
and a guardian! and when the Nobleman, who now so ably guides the
Naval counsels of the Nation, shall be removed from the seat of
power, either by a mortal or a political decree, may his successor,
like him, possess the disposition to recompence our merits, although
unbefriended by influence!</p>

<div class="fs90">

<p class="noindent"><span class="xl">T</span>he very important services of the fleets of Britain, through successive
generations, have justly entitled her Seamen to public recompence and
protection. Every means, therefore, which good policy or expediency
could suggest, have been adopted at different times, for their comforts and
welfare.</p>

<p>Whether from an illiberal distinction, or a faulty omission, I know not,
still the Marine Soldier, habitually a sharer in the dangers and the glory of
our Navy, notwithstanding such natural claims to notice, was, for a long
while, excluded from a participation in these humane regulations which
afforded independence to the destitute families of our Sailors when afar off
in their Country's service. It was reserved for a recent and a more
enlightened era to extend also to the Marine, a privilege which must
constitute the sweetest joy of every good man&mdash;that of allotting a part of his
pay, when embarked, and distant from his home, for the constant support
of a wife and family otherwise doomed to want, an aged parent weighed
down by poverty and years, or a dependant friend struggling hard against
adversity.</p>

<p>I shall state the nature of those rights which have progressively been
granted to the Marine Soldier, and point out the mode by which they can
be practically adopted. It is a tribute, however, meritedly due to the Right
Honorable Mr. Dundas, to remark, that from his intelligent and generous
conceptions, first emanated all these estimable privileges to the subordinates
in the Royal Corps of Marines, which were eagerly discussed and sanctioned
by a grateful Legislature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Without recurring to the express Acts of Parliament, upon which those
indulgencies are founded, I will simply digest their spirit, and detail the
necessary steps to be observed, under every possible contingency. It will
be proper to mention, in the first place, that every Marine Recruit should
intimate to his wife or kindred, immediately after his joining Head Quarters
at Chatham, Portsmouth, or Plymouth, the number <i>of the divisional Company</i>
to which he has been attached. Young men too frequently name only <i>their
parade Companies</i> which is of no use after they are embarked on board,
as such often undergo a change while they continue on shore. By
particularizing the former, it serves as a certain clue to their friends in
every enquiry concerning their destinies, and will correct mistakes when
two, or more, of a similar name shall happen to belong to the same ship or
division.</p>

<p>In April, 1763, Marine Soldiers obtained the right of following their
trades in any town of Great Britain (except those having Universities) after
their discharge from the service. This remains the same.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, for the guidance of legal heirs to prize-money, which
may be due to any deceased Marine Soldier, that if they do not exhibit their
claims <i>within</i> three years after notice has been given by the Agent or Agents,
of its being in course of payment, such goes into the funds of Greenwich
Hospital. This shews the absolute necessity of every family or kindred
maintaining a constant correspondence with their distant military friends,
and as the life of a Soldier is ever precarious, <i>he</i> should not fail to report, by
letter, the circumstantial particulars of each fortunate capture at sea, in
which he may have an interest, in order that his legal or designed heirs
may meet with little difficulty in tracing out where his property lays, in the
event of death.</p>

<p>As the Country wisely permits the Marine, in common with all the
subordinate servants of his Majesty, an Åconomical communication with
his dear and remote friends, by the abolition of every postage excepting the
payment of one penny, no occasion should be lost of availing himself of this
valuable privilege. From this item being lodged with each letter into the
office from whence it is dispatched, I am afraid, however, it often happens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
when on the eve of putting to sea, that those poor fellows, in the hurry of
the occasion, entrust their money and their secrets to unprincipled watermen,
who may be tempted to pocket the one, and destroy the other without a
chance of detection. <i>Were the receivers</i> of each letter obliged to pay this
little impost, correspondence might be more regular, such frauds prevented,
and the revenue continue unaltered.</p>

<p>By the benevolent Act of 1792 Non-Commissioned Officers and Private
Marines were allowed the privilege of allotting a portion of their pay
(usually a moiety) to their wives, families, or others, which, till that period,
was confined to the Seamen alone.</p>

<p>Immediately after embarkation, he who has a relative or a friend to
whom he inclines to allot such a part, should execute this instrument,
which the Captain of the ship he may belong to, will forward to the Navy
Board; the Treasurer of which, authenticates the ticket and transmits it to
the person for whose benefit it is designed.</p>

<p>The Receiver General of Land Tax, Collectors of Customs or Excise,
and Clerks of the Checque, are <i>officially</i> obliged to pay these allowances to
the holder of it, every four weeks, and should no money be in hand for the
purpose, one or other must name <i>a day of recall within a fortnight</i>, under a
penalty, as likewise if any deduction shall be made from the net sum.
Tickets of allotment are irrevocable by the grantor, while he lives and is
in public pay, unless he shews a very solid cause for cancelling them. If a
wife who holds one, having children <i>under fourteen</i>, shall die, the fact must
be attested by the Minister and Church Wardens of the parish, a person
named who undertakes to receive <i>their</i> future allowances, and all the
circumstances thus established must be remitted to the Navy Board for its
sanction. He who becomes the representative ought to appear in person to
receive such monies, unless prevented by sickness. But should a wife die
(leaving children of the above description) and if no steps are taken or any
claims made for their benefit, <i>within six months</i>, such allotments become void,
and they will in future be paid either to the grantor himself, or his heirs and
executors after his decease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who hold such tickets may always be assured of the friends who
gave them being alive, up to the date of the latest payment, as the Navy
Board never fails to acquaint those Agents who have been accustomed to
issue the money for allotments, with every death that happens; each of
whom is bound, under a penalty, to acknowledge the receipt of such an
intimation within two days. The same forms are observed in Ireland,
where allotments are paid by the Collectors or Commissioners of
Revenue.</p>

<p>All enquiries concerning the situation or destinies of distant relatives
serving in the Royal Marines when embarked on board of ship, should be
preferred to the Navy Board, Somerset Place, London, and through its
present Secretary, (R. A. Nelson,) or whoever may succeed him, as the
returns of ships are transmitted to that office, in which the Marines are
included. In order to identify the Soldier, about whom an enquiry is made
it is necessary to hand, at the same time, the <i>number</i> of his divisional
company, as well as that of his allotment ticket, if he has granted one.
Successful reference may also be had to the division, where he is attached,
by addressing a letter, "On his Majesty's service," to the Adjutant of it;
<i>always</i> remarking the <i>number</i> of his Company.</p>

<p>In the year 1792 Marines were placed on the same footing, and became
sharers in the benefit of an Act "To prevent frauds and abuses in payment
of wages, prize-money, and other allowances." Wills, or letters of Attorney,
when executed on board of ship, must be attested by the Captain, and one
or more of the <i>signing Officers</i>. They are not valid unless they are <i>revocable</i>.
The Captain acquaints the Navy Board in his ship's return when any
Seaman or Marine under his command has made his testament, which is an
evidence of the justice of future claims on his property in case of decease.
Any will made by either, after his discharge from the service, or any power
of Attorney affecting <i>pay</i>, <i>prize-money</i>, or other property acquired by him,
<i>while on board his Majesty's fleet, if executed within the bills of London or
Westminster</i>, must be attested by an Officer appointed by the Treasurer of the
Navy, <i>where wages are paid</i>. If either a will or power of Attorney, as above,
is made in England or Ireland, it must be witnessed by the Minister and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Church Wardens; if in Scotland, by the Clergyman and two Elders of that
parish in which the executor of such an instrument may reside.</p>

<p>Any Marine dying on board <i>intestate</i> upon information of his decease
reaching his friends, he who is entitled to his effects must give in a petition
to the Inspector of Wills, (J. Bedingfield, Esq.) Somerset Place, London,
or whoever may be his successor, <i>stating</i> the name of such Marine, to what
part of the King's dominions he belonged, the name of the ship or ships in
which he served, the applicant's own name, <i>at full length</i>, his relation to, or
connexion with the defunct, what other kindred the deceased may have
alive to the best of the petitioner's knowledge, and where resident. This
must be certified by two respectable housekeepers of the parish, town, or place
where the applicant dwells, who must aver that they believe such account
to be true, <i>which</i> is also to be attested by the Minister and Church Wardens,
that <i>those</i> subscribing witnesses live in the parish, and are of honest repute.
Upon a petition and a certificate, executed agreeable to such prescribed
forms, being transmitted to the Inspector of Wills, he will enquire into the
truth of all, and when satisfied that no will of the deceased remains with
him, he will send or deliver to the claimants an abstract of his petition,
with a note or ticket signed by himself and subjoined, marked by his stamp,
representing that such statement of the claimant appears just, and that the
person so petitioning may have letters of administration to the deceased,
<i>provided</i> he is otherwise entitled by law, <i>which</i> will be addressed to a Proctor
in Doctor's Commons, that letters may pass in favour of the applicant, while
the original petition and certificate are preserved on the records of the
Treasurer of the Navy and kept by him, and the letters of administration
must be lodged and registered in the same manner as the probates of wills,
with the Inspector, who must give a cheque signed and stamped by him, or
his representative, to the Administrators or their Attorneys, which will be
sufficient for either to demand payment of all sums due to them on account
of the deceased. Proctors are liable to a penalty of 500<i>l</i>. if aiding to procure
probates or letters of administration to empower any to receive pay, prize-money,
&amp;c. for service in the fleet, without having first obtained a certificate
from the Inspector of Wills and powers of Attorney, and they will,
moreover, be incapacitated from acting in any Ecclesiastical Court of Great
Britain or Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>Non-Commissioned Officers and Private Marines should be cautious to
execute latter wills and powers exactly conformable to the prescribed rules,
for if not attended to, they will be of no effect, besides the testator or
executor being subject to a penalty.</p>

<p>The stated fees of Proctors are as follow, and with them I shall close an
Appendix, which, I humbly trust, will prove of general benefit. Every
remark which it contains is alike applicable in pursuing the interests of the
heirs of Seamen as well as of Marines.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>All changes noted in the ERRATA (<a href="#Page_xvi">pg xvi</a>) have been applied to the
etext.</p>

<p>The first eighteen chapters of the original text had much more whitespace between
paragraphs than the later chapters. This is reflected in the etext.</p>

<p>The heading and signature lines of letters have been made consistent
in style; the printer sometimes combined them to save space on a page.</p>

<p>Three occurrences of the character Å¿ (long-form s) have been replaced
by the normal s. (<a href="#Page_1">Pg 1</a> also; <a href="#Page_5">pg 5</a> Brisbane; <a href="#Page_383">pg 383</a> sloop.)</p>

<p>Sometimes the currency symbol l (for libra, pounds) was used instead
of Â£. This has been changed to <i>l</i> for clarity. For example, 50l is
represented as 50<i>l</i>.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspelling in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained. For example:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
